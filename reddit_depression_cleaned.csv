"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",2360,2019-10-29 14:52:02,177,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/doqwow/our_mostbroken_and_leastunderstood_rules_is/,our mostbroken and leastunderstood rules is helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort so weve made a new wiki to explain it,we understand that most people who reply immediately to an op with an invitation to talk privately mean only to help but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster it usually works out quite differently here than when you say pm me anytime in a casual social context we have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves were hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here this is just a small start our new wiki page explains in detail why its much better to respond in public comments at least until youve gotten to know someone it will be maintained at rdepressionwikiprivatecontact and the full text of the current version is below summary anyone who while acting as a helper invites or accepts private contact ie pms chat or any kind of offsite communication early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement either way its unwise to trust them pm me anytime seems like a kind and generous offer and it might be perfectly wellmeaning but unless and until a solid rapport has been established its just not a wise idea here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately by posting supportive replies publicly youll help more people than just the op if your responses are of good quality youll educate and inspire other helpers applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet people who are struggling with serious mentalhealth issues often justifiably have a low tolerance for disappointment and a highlevel of everchanging emotional need unless the helper is able to make a 100 commitment to be there for them in every way for as long as necessary offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good this is why mentalhealth crisisline responders usually dont give their names and callers arent allowed to request specific responders its much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole analogously its much safer and healthier for our ops to develop a relationship with the community as a whole even trained responders are generally not allowed to work highintensity situations alone its partly about availability but its mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue if a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mentalhealth issues including suicidality which is often comorbid with depression escalate in a pm conversation its much harder for others including the rdepression and rsuicidewatch moderators to help contrary to common assumptions moderators cant see or police pms in our observation over many years the people who say pm me the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mentalhealth issues and mentalhealth support we all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively community input mitigates these limitations theres no reason why someone whos truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny if helpers are concerned about their own privacy keep in mind that selfdisclosure when used supportively is more about the feelings than the details and that we have no problem here with the use of altthrowaway accounts and have no restrictions on account age or karma we all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others these people do want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims there are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mentalhealth issues if a helper invites an op to talk privately and gives them a good supportive experience theyve primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers this sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someones in a state of mentalhealth crisis when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning if ops want to talk privately posting on a wideopen anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option although we dont recommend it we do allow ops to request private contact when asking for support if you want to do this please keep your expectations realistic and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to pm before opening up to them
"Regular check-in post, with essential information about our rules and resources","Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you're having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, or have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these aren't allowed standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule),  this is a place you can share.

-----

Our subreddit rules are very different from most of the rest of reddit!  Since all of them exist for important reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several resource wikis for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support  (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal issues. Grief, sadness, anger, loneliness and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",38,2025-04-14 06:26:08,94,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1jys8x9/regular_checkin_post_with_essential_information/,regular checkin post with essential information about our rules and resources,welcome to rdepressions checkin post a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing if youre having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post or have an accomplishment you want to talk about these arent allowed standalone posts in the sub as they violate the role model rule this is a place you can share our subreddit rules are very different from most of the rest of reddit since all of them exist for important reasons we ask everyone here to read and follow them please click report on any harmful content you see here we always want to know and deal as soon as we can we also have several resource wikis for help with finding and giving support provides guidance about what is and isnt a depressive disorder guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the depression label and redirect information for common offtopic issues offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mentalhealth issues in general and lots of guidance for learning what is and isnt usually helpful in giving peer support ysk that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see here are people breaking the private contact rule you should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here see im here to help posts this shows that you dont understand the most basic principles of peer support especially selectivity the giving help wiki explains more about this role modelling ie achievement or advice posts this is an expertfree zone thats what peer support means rule 5 we know that internet culture celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions nothing like that is ever acceptable here content thats more about making a statement or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support rules 1 2 and 10 offtopic posts about difficult situations or circumstances including interpersonal issues grief sadness anger loneliness and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses the what is depression wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues which are 100 valid and serious but inappropriate here
It pisses me off when I tell therapists/psychiatrists about suicide and they get scared,"Seems like the only solid solution they have is fear and guilt, they tell you ""You're scaring me, I might have to call x""  , or that people close to you will be sad, or if they're religious that you might go to hell etc. Can you please just be understanding with me and not fear monger? I know it's your duty to involuntarily stop me but it actually pisses me off, if you were really empathetic you would try some healthier fucking way instead of fear mongering.

I hope I could find some therapists who has been through such things and not some fucking dickhead who became a professional just to feel good about themselves and to get praise from others, legit people who know the pain.

I caught myself today.,"The past month and a half, i've let myself slip back into an unhealthy lifestyle.  
First it started with videogames. I started playing them again. After a week, i was playing all day, and i mean like actually 14+ hours a day.  
Then i let my diet start slipping, started ordering food delivery again. Eating unhealthy foods.  
Then i stopped exercising completely.  
Within the span of three weeks i was back to a completely unhealthy lifestyle.  
I stopped cleaning, my house quickly got disgusting.   
My lawn became overgrown and unkept.  
For me this is how it goes usually. I have an extremely addictive personality (cliche i know), and coupled with my depression, it is a recipe for disaster.  
When i start spiraling into a hole, i nose dive into that shit.  
But today, i woke up, hopped on the computer immediately as i usually do. But i just felt different.  
I felt present, mindful. I looked around at my filthy computer desk, and felt disgusted.  
I logged off the game and turned my computer off.  
I cleaned my office, my kitchen.    
I know it's just Day 1 for me, but I will not let this unhealthy, sad lifestyle continue.

the depression shadow,"was driving on my way to get coffee after dropping off a package. it wasn't a horrible trip or anything stressful. i was dropping off a package with a popmart figurine someone else wanted & was trading for one i wanted. something i've been into for a while & is a hobby i enjoy. i was getting coffee as a treat, something i also really enjoy & reward myself when i go outside by myself without having an anxiety attack. i was listening to a dj mix i put together & feel really proud about, was appreciative of how nice the weather is & saw some good clouds.

Do I need to even bother living if I struggle so much with doing basic things?,"I struggle with ADHD/Autism/Depression/Anxiety/ED maybe all my life (Pick a struggle, yes I know), to the point where it affects my day to day life. My ADHD affects my daily routine. I procrastinate my daily tasks such as taking my medication, waking up in the morning, being on time for class/work, being distracted when doing HW etc etc. I know the importance of doing all of these things, yet I struggle even with medication. On top this, I struggle with depression and anxiety. I often have compulsive spending issues. I buy things frequently when I don’t need it or should really wait until my next paycheck. I am getting an inheritance with great money, but with my poor saving skills, Right now I have nothing to show for it. Again, I fully understand the importance of this, but I struggle greatly.

Whenever I try to start a good habit, like trying to work out more frequently, learning a hobby or counting my calories, it’s also a struggle. Whenever I try to introduce a new habit, I drop it a month or so later. Again, I really want to do these things for my own betterment, but I just crash out. My motivation for these things would just stop abruptly out of no where, even though I started off so strongly. While waking up and doing basic tasks is an everyday battle for me, others it’s so simple. They do it, plain and simple. They wake up and do the things they need to do. I’m envious of people who can take hold of their life. I really try to better myself, by trying new habits, medication or therapy. But I still hit bumps in the road.

I am 2 years until graduating college in my mid 20s and I am still unsure of what career path I want to pursue. I don’t mean to sound so negative, but I honestly don’t see a future for myself. If I struggle so much with these things, things that every human can do, then something is really wrong with me. I don’t mean to sound really crazy, but I just can’t live like this anymore. I don’t see a point in living anymore if I continue to struggle with pathetic things like I listed before. I will talk to my psychiatrist on the 7th on potential medicine changes.

Even with all my faults, am I still valued at life? Even if everyone else on the planet is better than me in every aspect, am I still worth something? The things that I struggle with, employers won’t care. The real world doesn’t care. They only care if you can do your job or not. If I can’t do that, then should I even continue living?",3,2025-07-05 16:19:09,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1lsdmgd/do_i_need_to_even_bother_living_if_i_struggle_so/,do i need to even bother living if i struggle so much with doing basic things,i struggle with adhdautismdepressionanxietyed maybe all my life pick a struggle yes i know to the point where it affects my day to day life my adhd affects my daily routine i procrastinate my daily tasks such as taking my medication waking up in the morning being on time for classwork being distracted when doing hw etc etc i know the importance of doing all of these things yet i struggle even with medication on top this i struggle with depression and anxiety i often have compulsive spending issues i buy things frequently when i dont need it or should really wait until my next paycheck i am getting an inheritance with great money but with my poor saving skills right now i have nothing to show for it again i fully understand the importance of this but i struggle greatly whenever i try to start a good habit like trying to work out more frequently learning a hobby or counting my calories its also a struggle whenever i try to introduce a new habit i drop it a month or so later again i really want to do these things for my own betterment but i just crash out my motivation for these things would just stop abruptly out of no where even though i started off so strongly while waking up and doing basic tasks is an everyday battle for me others its so simple they do it plain and simple they wake up and do the things they need to do im envious of people who can take hold of their life i really try to better myself by trying new habits medication or therapy but i still hit bumps in the road i am 2 years until graduating college in my mid 20s and i am still unsure of what career path i want to pursue i dont mean to sound so negative but i honestly dont see a future for myself if i struggle so much with these things things that every human can do then something is really wrong with me i dont mean to sound really crazy but i just cant live like this anymore i dont see a point in living anymore if i continue to struggle with pathetic things like i listed before i will talk to my psychiatrist on the 7th on potential medicine changes even with all my faults am i still valued at life even if everyone else on the planet is better than me in every aspect am i still worth something the things that i struggle with employers wont care the real world doesnt care they only care if you can do your job or not if i cant do that then should i even continue living

I don't have any friends, no social life, no connection, no relationship, no one to share my feelings with anyone or study together. I didn't get any good internship this summer. I tried so many times but I failed. This summer, I took some classes hoping to be the best version of myself. But my grades are going to be bad as always. My parents don't understand me. Everyone blames me. Before coming to college, I had everything perfect. Perfect grades, life, friendships, jobs, good relationship with parents, and what not. Today, I am thinking about me. I failed myself, I failed everyone. I failed to get good grades, get a good job, and made everything bad for me and others. At this moment, I am thinking what's the purpose of my life. I am feeling like it'd be better if I am not in this world. But I still have dreams. What should I do? Is there anything I can do? I am a failure. My parents thing it's me who doesn't want to study.

How to fill my days?,"Like many who post in this sub Reddit I am incredibly lonely. I wake up, go to work then try to kill time until I can sleep again. Absolutely nothing brings me any joy and things that I used to do to kill time now just irritate me so I often just lie on my bed in silence for hours until I can fall asleep.

Becoming Actively Suicidal,"I'm so very, very lonely. As someone with ASD level 2, I have always struggled greatly with social interactions. I haven't had a friend in so many years. That combined with crippling manic depression and I've frankly been hollowed out from the inside. 

I go outside and socialise, trying to form bonds, and I've consistently failed, forming short-lived, nonreciprocal, and unsustainably shallow connections, at best. I've followed the advice of ""love yourself"" and ""learn to be okay with being alone"" and stuff. It may have offered short term reprieve, but it hasn't addressed the underlying issue. It addresses the symptom, not the virus. But, I can't ignore it, anymore. It hurts too much to push aside with a new ""mindset"" or whatever. This stuff about ""learning to be okay with being alone"" only applies to someone who has already has a fruitful external support system to lie back on. Otherwise, it is a merely short term fix. Like slapping a bandaid on it. That's been my experience, at least. Belonging comes before self actualisation on Maslow's hierarchy of needs for a reason.

I seem to be unable to force friendships. This is a challenge that exceeds willpower. It takes skills I don't possess as an autistic boy. It's like I'm in purgatory, forced to wait for something to happen organically. For someone who I can form a bond with to approach me, first. Waiting for the day it just happens. A day that feels like it will never come, no matter how many clubs I join or people I reach out to. I'm so alone. I'm miserable. I haven't found fulfilment in life. I'm tired. This isn't sustainable. They say that the more needy you become the less approachable you'll be. So, as I become more lonely, I become more miserable. As I become more miserable, I become more needy. And, as I grow more needy, I grow more lonely. It's a cycle of neverending torment. I understand that this is what that love.yourselfnadvice aims to address, but it's merely a temporary boost, like I said. I've lost the energy to do it.

I find forming bonds, especially romantic ones, to be the most important part of life. And I don't have it. It takes everything in my power to not grow resentful. I want it all to end. I don't want to die, but I don't want to keep living this way, either. If I stay this way for too long and it just gets worse, I may prefer death over living. I hate it. I'm so miserable. I'm broken. I wish I wasn't disabled so that social interaction is that much harder for me. I can't connect with people. I haven't in such a long time. It's isolation. I've been isolated for years. I promise I'm not an incel. Technically I am, but I'm not like that stereotype where I'm all sexist and stuff. No one has to be with me as a friend or otherwise just because I'm suicidal. If someone doesn't like me they don't like me. It's not their fault, really. I have no right to feel anger towards them. But, it can be hard to not, sometimes.

It's been so long that I don't remember what happiness exactly looks like. For me, the most important connections are romantic. Romantic love is my favourite, most powerful emotion. Yet, I've never been able to show it to anyone, much less have it reciprocated, before. I imagine someone who I can talk to easily. I've had it in the past. Years ago. Someone who I don't have to force conversation with. Someone who I can talk to for a long time without realizing how much time has gone by. Someone who makes me laugh, and someone who I make laugh. Someone who I can embrace. Someone who I can kiss. Someone who I am exclusive with. Someone who has me as their best friend as I do them. It's stupid, I know. I know logically I'm just seeing things through rose tinted glasses. I'm sure this is an unrealistic expectation for me, but it's what I dream of. I'm so sorry.

I don't feel excited by things anymore. I don't feel positive emotions, anymore. Not to a particularly strong degree, anyway. I don't smile. I don't feel good. It's a constant, sickening pain that's with me 24/7. Things that used to bring me joy -- like music, writing, learning, and exercise -- feel bland, now.

I have had innumerous therapists in the past. None have quite clicked. One of the biggest challenges is the time. 1 hour a week is nowhere close to the amount of support I need. But, my family can't afford more. They can barely afford what I had before. I genuinely think my life is in danger. That I may do someone extraordinarily drastic quite soon, and I don't know what to do to stop myself. I've reached out and the support I've received has been luck lustre. My parents have observed my depression for so long that they're burnt out, not knowing what to do for me anymore. Mum says she's given up. I feel like the true gravity of my situation isn't being clocked by others. I struggle greatly with communicating these things, especially given my ASD.

The last time I remember feeling something that resembled happiness was a bittersweet moment. I listened to a song called ""it's been a long, long time"" and it made me extremely emotional. Blissful, sure, but it also reminded me of how lonely I am. I related to it on such a deep level. So, I felt a mix of joy and excitement at having felt seen whilst listening to a really beautiful song. I also felt a little more empty. More hopeless. I finished the song with a powerful sense of longing that I had repressed long ago. I have since been forced to repress it, again, as these emotions are never sated. That's likely another reason why I desire romance so much. It will allow me to feel these emotions without feeling like I'm missing something. I'll finally have someone to share the emotions with instead of having it linger in solitude before fading into resentment of myself and the world.

I don't know who I'd reach out to. Suicide hotlines are terrible and ineffective, but anything else would require some sort of admission into an asylum or something. I can't do that. Not now. I'm about to graduate and need to be able to dedicate time to my studies. I don't feel like I have time to dedicate to something like an asylum.

I'm sorry. I'm sick of the cookie cutter ""I'm here for you"" or ""your not alone"" or ""it gets better"" crap. I'm sure they mean well, but it is extraordinarily unhelpful.

I've reached out to the school. It's exhausting. I've gone to the counselor, but it hasn't been helpful to me for the same reasons that other therapists haven't helped: I simply need more time to talk about these things than I'm given. The school isn't willing to give me more time for my mental health at the expense of my time at school and I haven't felt comfortable pushing for it. I go to a small school where it's difficult to meet new people my age. I've done other things like join clubs and such, but to no avail. ASD makes it feel impossible. Everything I do is wrong in a way I don't understand. The way I walk, talk, inflect, move my face muscles, and hold my posture are all wrong, I've been told at various stages in my life. And, they're right. It's obvious to me, too. Being level 2 makes me too autistic for most other people with ASD. I also struggle to interact with other people with ASD 2 or higher, likely for the same reasons others struggle to interact with me.

No matter how much I force it, a relationship simply won't come to me. I just have to wait for something to form organically. It's happened in the past. Times that I hit myself to this day for letting slip by me. Who knows how long it could be for it to happen again. 

I've been going outside and interacting with random people and joining groups as much as I can hoping to optimize my chances, but it's been years. I don't think I'll be able to hold out for long enough. I fear I'll give in before it comes to me. That my salvation with take too long. That I'll have killed myself before it comes. I know you can't help with this.  I don't know what in the hell to fucking do. I'm going to die. Or at least attempt it. I really, really, really don't want to. I'm so young and I want to have something good. But, I already feel so drained. I fear it may be the better alternative to living. It's like I've exhausted all other options. I need something external, now. Something outside of my control. Yet, I've been left high and dry. Now, I'm slipping. I'm losing my mind. I've already lost so many parts of me that I'll never get back. I used to be energetic I used to be funny I used to laugh all the time depression has taken it from me. Even in the best case scenario I will not heal entirely.

I'm constantly told to address short term things. Things that will make me feel better in the moment. They used to give me reprieve. However, their effectiveness has faded over time as the crux of my problems fails to be addressed.

I'm afraid the situation has become far too dire. I am in need of drastic intervention asap. I am on the verge of a suicide attempt. I don't want to die. I really don't want to die. But I think I'm going to do it. Please help me. I'm scared. I don't want to die. I think I'm going to do it. I think it's going to be soon. I want it to get better but it won't. So, the next best thing is for it to stop. I'm so sorry. I'm very very sorry. I need help. I'm scared. I don't want to die. I think depression will be with me forever. It's like a parasite Moments where I should feel happy make me overwelmed with melancholyim not even thinking about depression when it hits me. It comes out from nowhere. I can't keep gong with this over my head. It takes the meeanning from everything meaningful. I feel alone. No one's helping me. I don't think anyone knows how to help me. Even I don't know how to help myself. I can't imagine myself with a happy future. It all feels melancholy, even when I know logically that these futures that I imagine are supposed to be happy ones.

I don't belong anywhere and want to give up,"Just leaving a long term abusive marriage brutally, and I had a conversation with my co worker and his words solidified what I have felt for a long time. 

He said that I don't deserve it and it's outside my control, but he said it's really disheartening and really sorry to see that everything is somehow always so quickly fell apart for me. 

I am now 37.

16 years ago my mom passed away and the rest of my family abandoned me. 2 years later my then boyfriend for 7 years cheated on me twice and left me as well.

Somehow I was able to kept on living. I spent my 20s surviving on my own and it made my 20s very isolated. I didn't have the chance to do what people in their 20s normally do. I was single for 8 years. Isolated and depressed and exhausted to the point I developed a chronic illnesses. 

I didn't have sex until I was 32, and that relationship was ended in only 9 months. 

I work my ass off since work is always the last lifeline I have. Like I don't have anything else in life if not for work. Somehow I got lucky at work and I was relocated to a first world country from a third world country. I was happy for a little while, but guess what, somehow the company shut down in only a little than 2 years. I feel like I worked so hard, the build up for the relocation was all of my 20s spent for this achievement and it crumbles apart only in 2 years time. 

At 34 I met my then to be husband, and we were LDR for 3.5 years. He saved me when the company shut down, he brought me to his country and we finally got together in person. There were so many good things in the relationship but sadly it's also very emotionally abusive, and it got physical one time too. I just moved country for him and now I am forced to leave again just only after 9 months. 

My co worker is right. Things, especially good things fell apart so quickly for me. 

Is there something wrong with me? Why can't I have good things that last, but bad times persist so long? I struggle whole of my 20s but happiness/stability doesn't even last 2 years for me

Now that I am 37, people said that ah you are still so young. But my life experiences up until this point already destroyed me mentally and physically. I am so exhausted beyond belief. If everything I do, I worked hard for, fell apart just in such a short time, why bother anymore? Why still trying so goddamn hard?

I am tired of life. When I go to a crowded mall and see oceans of people I see a lot of normality where people have partners, families, friends, money, having fun shopping and laugh with their loved ones etc. I feel so isolated and lonely and I feel I don't belong anywhere. 

Ever since my mom passed 16 years ago all I ask is I want to have a partner where I can spend the rest of my life with. Where we always be together, facing the good and the bad of life together. Figuring things out together. Feel safe in each other and loyal to each other. 

 I said to my then husband that if we can enjoy this just 5 years more, together, I will be 42 and if I die by then or just as all people getting older, maybe I will be diagnosed with scary illness, but I will be ok with it cause I never have any stability in my life. Just let me taste and enjoy that 5 years cause I never have it. And it would be enough for me.
But that 5 years too, somehow I couldn't have it. 


Why bother trying anymore.

The self hatred is extreme today.,"It's July 4th here in the US. A major holiday where people have fun, go on a trip, grill out, go to the beach or pool, etc. Not me.

I haven't had fun on a holiday since I was about 12 years old. I have no joy in life. I'm sitting in my room, where I spend 95% of my time, just on my computer. I have no friends, I live with my mom who is elderly and can't walk, so she can't go out. All throughout my life, she shunned the rest of the family so now it's only her and I. I feel like she's isolated me.

I'm a 35 year old woman and my life is boring and unhappy. I work from home, which I do love, but it's hard when my time off is also spent sitting here on my computer mindlessly scrolling social media. Right now I have a headache from staring at this screen for the past 6 hours straight.

I wish I could be better with my appearance, but any time I make an effort, I fail. Like if I spend over an hour on my hair, it still looks fucking stupid and I'm very scared that I appear like I don't know how to take care of myself like some crazy recluse. Even though I've tried to do my makeup weekly for the past 20 years, it still looks bad.. my eyebrows end up uneven, my eyeshadow is blotchy.. it's just terrible. I can't match colors for the life of me. I really hate myself that I can't just look like one of the ""pretty"" girls who have nice makeup and clothes. I always look like a slob with clown makeup smeared all over my face and my hair is out of control. I hate myself!

If I got dressed right now, I'm envisioning a cute outfit and looking attractive. But if I put on the outfit, I won't look anything like I'm picturing in my head and that causes me to hate myself, this vicious cycle goes on and on and on. My clothes never fit right, my hair always looks like a mess, and my makeup is never normal looking. I just feel like an ugly freak all the time instead of a pretty, elegant type of woman.

When I'm not working or mindlessly scrolling, I'm cleaning or doing some chore. Yet I do these things all right. My mom taught me to forget everything else when work needed to be done around the house, so that's the only thing I really do right. I feel like in a way she conditioned my brain to not care about things like appearance, hobbies, etc. Those things were not important.

I am so tired please,"Why cant this guy leave me alone I am disgusted by his face I feel my body giving up whenever I see his face. I never did anything to hurt this person. I forgave him when he cheated I took his abuse I kept my mouth shut when he was raping me ykw it was all my fault to give him so many chances that now he thinks he has access to me. 
I don't want revenge I won't go to the police (I cant anyway) I'll never tell a soul what kind of person he is and in return I only wanted one thing and that was to just leave me fucking alone but he won't

I am so afraid every minute of what he'll do. I dont use social media anymore, I threw away my simcard, I don't talk to anyone, I think about ending myself all the time. I tear up every time I am left alone with my thoughts. I cry half a day everyday. Why? Just why can't people be a little sympathetic? why can't people leave someone alone when that person is begging them?

Another time is when my friend gave me a book cus mine finished she beat me to a pulp cus why would i take someone elses book. theres so many memories of them i lost the count, i get i was a troubled/spoiled kid and sometimes i just sit there and think i deserve it. most of the time it was my mum with mental and physical abuse which has become so common im just used to it, recently. back in october, my dad seen that i put the frozen food in a way that it fell in the fridge, my parents beat me up so much cus of that, my dad broke my keyboard and they tried to burn my school uniform, i was so fed up i just decided to swallow some pills and just end it all but it never worked, from there on because it was my final year both my parents became significantly worse over time and it just led me to do drugs/smoking up until i got caught in january, when i decided to run away from home and stay with a friend, they bombed my phone with phone calls and messages saying they would change and not do it again, i was so naive i believed them and after every argument they would change for like 1-2 weeks then they would go back to being themselves, another time was in april of this year when my parents beat me to a pulp because i was watching the grand prix instead of studying. i was so pissed i just decided to throw my books on the floor and dindt decide to kms. however since october ive been extremely suicidal and this one friend tries to help me, she tries her best i know that, but im mentally too damaged to fix myself. and yesterday, i broke my phone cause i was angry i know dickhead move, i was so scared what my mum would do that i hid it and acted like i lost it, she found it today and just spilled everything of my past i did to her and she does this everytime we have an argument, she compares me so much it just exhausting to bear with her, sometimes tho i just think i deserve it because i was always a dick to my brother and my parents, misbehaving everywhere just to disrespect them, i wasnt religious as they wanted and they say i dont fear my religion thats why they say i try to commit suicide, i plan to kms tonight and just felt like saying to someone as now i dont have a phone to talk to my friend and needed someone to speak to.

This all Dosent make sense,"I keep remembering my small village. Forest that me, dad and my grandma used to discover. I remember the smell of the grass and berries, light breese on my skin. I remember night felt so eeri and mysterious when i was going through then with my dad. I remember a big coutch where i used to have so many memories with him, even my mother. We were like a family. I remember my pets i loved full heartly and my love for them was so... pure? I remember watching shows, cartoons. Everyday seemed like exiting adventure. I was full of fantasies i wanted to release one day into something. I thought i can be anything i want. I was hopefull. Everyone around seemed like a friend a didn't discovered yet. Adults or kids. I had a big heart when i was a kid. It dosent make sense now. Liken what happened? What decision... what impacted me so much that it all feels like a dream? My childhood isn't mine. Me isn't... That me anymore. That full of life kid long far gone, here I'am to replace them. I'am timid, I'am scared of everything. It allmost feels like I'am incompetent at everything i do. I feel like I'am not able to create genuenly connections anymore, and now they tend to feel like a chore. I don't look in the sky with hopes and dreams. I look down onto my toes fearing a next day to come. Something inside me feels deeply shattered, empty, dull. It feels like i want change but change dosent want me. I feel sad all the time. I feel hurt all the time. I'm not exited for anything. All i have mentsl capacity for is to play stupid videogames. And i don't even draw anymore. It feels like i used to be a flower who eberyone loves abd people even find me inspiring at some degree. But now I'am forgotten in the trash can, slowly rot day by day. I think i don't really wanna get better? I don't know. Often i cry. Sometimes i yell ""mother, please take me home"" not even referring to my bio mother cause i don't feel anything for her. I think about suicide more and more. I feel isolated in my own body, in my head. Usless abd incompetend. OH AND CHERRY on top is being trans. It's like my life wasn't twisted enough, but someone above decided to spice things up. I'am tired of feeling judged. Tired of feeling like I'am lesser then otther women. Tired to feel like a freak, tired to feel like my body is just spontaneous combination thst dosent make sense (but this one is managable at least) jt hurts when people you loved don't wanna bother recognise you and your feelings. It hurts being ostracised just for being yourself. I wish it all will be over. I wish i could end this? Not really but i want this pain to stop. And maybe then i will woke up. I will woke up hearing my beloved grandma calling me to the kitchen. She brewed my favorite cacao. The gentle care of my dad, who's gonna show me something bew and exiting. Forest. My favorite books, my friends. My flaming hopes and dreams. Maybe i could make everything right if i had second chance.

Need help urgently!,"A friend of mine has expressed strong suicidal thoughts and tendencies, and has been having panic attacks for the last six months.
He refuses help, doesn’t interact with counsellors and says that they always contradict him and he’s tired of it.

Need some recommendations for online support groups so he at least has somebody to talk to.

His symptoms aggravated after a bad break up and friend group split, so he doesn’t really have anyone to talk to.

I only got to know him 3/4 months back so he doesn’t really see me as a friend tbh. I am also in a hectic state of life right now, so I am scared to insert myself into his life only to be unavailable when he needs it. 

His family is aware of his panic attacks but so far, haven’t really done anything as far as I know.

The state of psychiatric care where we live is honestly not great, so I can see why he doesn’t really fit in with the therapists.

Need some international resources that are of good quality so he can get the help he needs.

How…,"I’ve been trying to stop taking my antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds for the past two weeks because of the brain fog. The fog has gotten a bit better, but now I’m starting to slip into a depressive episode again , I feel low, unmotivated, and don’t want to do anything again. 

The biggest thing I’ve noticed is that my appetite is completely gone again. When I was on the medication, I was constantly hungry. Even I never want to cook but the meds change me into someone crave food and cook so much. But now it’s been more than week and I haven’t had a proper meal , just milk and bread.

All this progress means nothing.,"I've been making so much progress over the past year. But ive just no realized, it doesn't matter. Nothing that matters changed. And it was something so insignificant that made me realize. Part of my ""progress"" was trying to take care of my appearance.  This included trying to dress better and getting professional haircuts. Thisneas hard for me as I dont really think anything makes me look better so I feel stupid even trying. 

But I thought I had to try anyway. But for about 8 months now, ive been getting 65$ haircuts. And I've never really received any comments on them, but I just assumed, or rather was hoping, that the reason i hadn't recieved any comments on it, or anything else about my appearance, was because there was no one in my life to make those comments. I just trusted that they were making a difference.  And same with my ""improved"" wardrobe.  And the 65lbs that i lost. 

But that tiny bit of false hope was shattered yesterday.  I had to leave a bit early from work yesterday morning because I had an appointment to get my haircut,  and so I let my client know. I got my haircut. And this was actually the first time i was feeling good about it. But then, when i head into work last night, the first thing my client says to me is ""if you hadn't told me you were getting a haircut, I woudlnt have even noticed. Hell I still cant even notice"".
 
It kinda felt like he hit me in the chest with a sledge hammer when he said that. And thats when I realized. That every single bit of progress ive made, ultimately meant nothing. Not the weight loss, not the haircuts, not the wardrobe,  not the therapy, not the financial progress, not one single thing. It doesn't matter.  

That was kinda the first time I really stopped and looked around. And I realized that nothing that matters has changed. I am still so alone. I have absolutely nobody in my life. And im not a notable part of anyone else's life. And there is not a single point on my life that I enjoy.

Extremely sad,Feeling depressed because my nervous systems fucked and I keep falling into the same cycles that hold me back and keep me down. Super disappointed in myself and the life I’ve created for myself. I wish I knew how to properly open up to people with words. I wear my heart on my sleeves so I always show it even when I don’t want to which I hate but it’s so hard because what I really need is therapy. I feel like I don’t even know how to feel safe enough to do that with friends. Haven’t done it since high school. I had a lot of fall outs by the end of high school but that’s a story for another day. Then I basically dug myself into a deeper hole of isolation for years doing more drugs that made me comfortable enough doing and saying unhinged things for so long that it was no longer out of character moments but just me which obviously made me more unlikeable but anyways I’ve been trying to get out of my shell more and with people who have their degrees and own places/careers and they’re all so sweet but I guess I just struggle now with accepting that they would want to be my friend. But if I’m being honest it’s hard for me to believe anyone regardless of what jobs they have that they really care. Anyways thanks for listening I know this is all my stuff to deal with and I’m not a victim to the way I was raised anymore but I guess I’m still grieving how my life could’ve gone differently even if it’s pointless or won’t change anything. It’s embarrassing though because I feel like I have the emotional regulation tools of a teen as a 24yr old and social anxiety has always been one of my BIGGEST struggles and I just feel really embarrassed whenever I’m called “adorable” after I realized I said something stupid.

Is it really over?,"I (25F) was in a 6-month relationship with my ex (25M). We were really close, talked every day, shared movies and games, met weekly, had intimacy, and everything felt good overall.
One day I expressed that I felt a lack of attention compared to the beginning. The next day, he told me he wanted to break up. He said I loved him more than he loved me, and that staying would be dishonest.
He refused to try to fix it, even when I suggested taking a break instead of ending it. Eventually, he unfollowed and removed me from social media and disappeared. That 3 months weeks ago.

We had no toxic fights, no cheating, nothing major. I still love him deeply and miss him terribly. I cry often, can’t sleep or eat properly, and feel stuck in the past. I’ve been hoping maybe he’ll come back when things settle for him (he’s doing his military service), but there’s been zero contact from his side.

My question is:
Should I still hold on to the hope that he might come back someday, or is it better to fully let go and accept that it’s really over?

I feel like everybody on Earth freaking hates me!,"I've been dealing with my grandads death for 2 years now! 2! Wow! And nobody even cares! I have clinical and persistent depression at once so I've lost interests in multiple things and I found a new interest which is anime which nobody even likes but I do thanks to a song called AISCREAM. Anyway back on topic. So it all started off with my grandads funeral in February 2023 and then I moved out of town away from my mother with my horrible brother and dad for nearly a year and I noticed serious changes in ther personality and acts and I just wanna yell at them about it at this point but I'm too scared too. And since we moved back to my old place with my mother and my dad and brother and dad have gotten worse and started acting quite... well... mean and pathetic towards me recently. My brother always comes into my room and after he's done harassing me, he just stands in my room for seconds or minutes watching my privacy for a while and then leaves. I feel like yelling at him for it but I know he'll beat me up or get up me for it so I hesitate. Oh and he always says I'm childish or I get reactions though I dont and I know it! My mom comes into my room and says ""Uuuooggghhh, I'm coming in for internet"" AND THERE IS NO FUCKING INTERNET IN MY ROOM!!! She just wants to invade my personal space and piss me the fuck off! And sometimes they try to slow make me angry with conversations I don't want and them escalate the situation on purpose for fun! And I tell my dad not to get on calls while I'm driving because it distracts me extremely bad and he makes excuses just so he can make the calls anyway saying ""Just focus on the road"" or ""It's not about you"" but does thay matter!? NO!!! It's a fucking distraction! He just wants to kill us all when I lose concentration and crash or run into someone! Or he wants me to be a bad driver for the rest of my life and doesn't want me to learn because I'm from Australia and I'm on my learners and I'm a horrible driver! And sometimes when I refuse something, my mother gets super angry about it or even when I try to do something I need to but I change my mind and then she gets super angry with me for it like when I had to grab a bowl and they were in the dishwasher so I didn't bother and she just angrily stopped the dishwasher and told me to grab a bowl and then she trapped me in my room for hours! Fucking ridiculous! She just gets mad over the littlest of things! And my family slaves me making me do every task instead of me doing it or I have to literally fucking do it with them like I have to go downstairs and do clothes with my brother and he forces me to do it! I'm like the youngest in my house and I'm 17 and I have I stamina whatsoever AND I GET FUCKING SLAVED!!! And also I used to go to Gold Coast theme parks until closing time but now I'm required to leave at 2PM instead because my mother is a FUCKING BITCH!!! And I was allowed to go to places at so early in the morning, I can't ever see the fucking streets but now I'm fucking required to go somewhere at 7AM or 8AM! FUCKING REALLY!!!??? And I have autism, anxiety, depression a lot of other horrible mental disorders and disabilities and I'm being fucked over by my family! WOW! And I have no fucking friends and my girlfriend cheated on me so I know people hate me! I've tried talking about my depression but no one even cares! I think they prefer me dead or some crap! I have many hopes and dreams that I won't even achieve because of my laziness and my horrible stupidity! I try to watch Love Live on my phone but that doesn't do shit!If this shit keeps going on with my family all this bullying and stuff, I'll call the fucking cops and tell them everything they did to me for years! I know no one will even care about anything I said in this post but if that's true, go ahead and say it so I can end myself right here! If you do care, it least show me you do. I need some people to care so I can keep going and I can keep going with life and be happy.

Boredom,"I can't tell if depression causes boredom or if boredom is depression inducing. I feel so bored with life. I feel trapped to live this mundane boring existence for another 40 years. Its overwhelming. 

I make more money than ever, but somehow feel more limited than ever. I have few friends, and am finding myself feeling like I no longer know how to communicate with them. I have lost interest in hobbies, partially due to cost and partially due to lack of interest. 

I feel like I am going crazy. I am irritated all of the time. I just get up, walk my dog, work out, work all day, walk the dog, sometimes cook, read or crochet, and then sleep. Over and over again.

A waste of resources and a burden on my family,"I voluntarily quit my job after just 2 weeks. It was at an Amazon fulfillment center and I was in pick. The job was so incredibly easy, but standing for 10 hours a day, 4 days a week doing the same thing over and over became a mental and physical strain. I spent my entire day sleeping until I had to go to work, then pass out the moment I got home. Eating anything would make me nauseous so I opted to just have a protien shake before I went in. 
I've had a lot of trouble finding a job before this and my parents were so proud of me finding an actual full time job. I'm 23 and currently live with my parents. I dropped out of college but want to return starting with community college. I wanted to touch it out and develop the mental fortitude to keep going, but I just couldn't. I have yet to tell my dad, but I'm sure he'll be so disappointed in me.
Everything was handed to me on a silver platter: good benefits, decent pay for entry level, a short commute, but I still couldn't do it. Amazon is supposed to be a cake-walk compared to other warehouse jobs and I still fucking failed. I feel so pathetic and weak. I hate being so weak, I hate taking advantage of my parents, I don't want to be a burden on them anymore. They work so hard just to keep the lights on and I've done absolutely nothing for them.

Whats the point of all of these?,"Working 80 hours per week, my routine is wake up, work, sleep and repeat. I got no friends, single for my whole life, had bad relationship with my family.

"The nonsensical ramblings of some depressed individual going through an existential crisis that nobody should, or will read.","I feel like I'm going insane. I really don't know what the hell I need to hear that's going to help me. Hopefully, someone will tell me something that is different from the cliche predetermined answers that I've already been told countless times. No, I don't want to ""live the moment"" or to ""focus on stuff I can control"". I don't want to keep ignoring all of this. I only want answers. Answers which I'm certain don't exist in this reality.

I keep having intrusive thoughts about abstract concepts like ""reality"" and my ""consciousness"" keeping me up at night. Things like how the Universe did have a beginning and will eventually end. Unlike what is infinite, that which always was and always will be: Reality. A reality in which a universe like ours can be and was created. But how does the rest of reality, outside of the Universe we inhabit, look like? Is it black, like space? But how could you tell it apart from the Universe(s?) within it? Would there even be a point in trying to tell them apart? What is the purpose of it all?

I keep thinking of what will happen to me after I die. Not my body, my skin or my bones. Not even my memories. But ""me"". My ""self"". What does that existence (or lack thereof) feel like? Of course, the obvious answer is that it feels like nothing at all, which is why I always end up thinking of ""myself"" (as in, my current stream of consciousness) like a series of random electricity currents moving from one funky-looking specialized cell to another. One could even zoom in closer to reveal myself to be a series of atoms, arranged in such a way that they just so happen to generate these thoughts, which are telling my fingers, also made of random atoms, to write these words on this imaginary wall, which will then somehow send some invisible waves through a cable, and then to space, just so that some electricity turns some 0's into 1's and some other brains, piloting their respective human bodies, can look at them on their own imaginary walls. Their eyes sending a meaningless visual signal, which will then be interpreted according to meaningless rules, in their meaningless brains. No offense, of course.

What will happen in the future? And I'm not talking about humanity here, All Tomorrows has already desensitized me to any of that. I don't care about planets, or stars, either. I know what will happen to all of those, even though none of us, probably nobody at all will ever get to see it, or even exist when it happens. The Universe will probably somehow collapse as well, I really don't care how. I'm talking about Reality. If when I die, I'll stop ""experiencing"" time, and just jump to the next point in ""time"" in which I can be aware of myself again, will that be at the end of Reality? But its whole premise is that it doesn't end!

Sometimes I think that maybe I'll wake up inside an alien's body. Or a robot. Some kind of vessel that some inter-dimensional, all-powerful being has chosen to re-activate my consciousness inside of, for whatever incomprehensible reason. And I'd be okay with that! Whatever would better than to just stop existing. I don't believe in ""a fate worse than death"". Then again, does your stream of consciousness ""continue"" if your memories are dumped inside a new recipient? I think that would just create a new being that just THINKS that it was you just a moment ago, all while your actual ""self"" is gone forever. Or maybe this god (lowercase G) has discovered a way to actually allow my existence to continue. Maybe it'll even allow me to keep all my memories!

Depressed any advice,"I'm 20, I have a shitty job atm temporary contract which will end soon now when I say shitty job I'm talking about the pay it's like 1k.
Enough to get me by.
I applied to a lot of jobs but nothing.
Now overall I'm fairly active, I do some parkour sometimes, I train a bit almost every day, I have a best friend we go out sometimes, now ofc most days after work I just stay inside but when I'm at work I stay mostly outside.
I'm saying this because most common advice for depression is to be more active,social etc.
But it doesn't rly work. As I said a real issue ATM is money I tried some online stuff which they failed mostly making games and programming.
I don't have a driver's license yet can't really go to college since I'm broke nor can I get said license for the same reason.
I never had a relationship which rly bothers me ngl. since I'm 20
Tho I would say I'm generally pretty awkward when it comes to women and shit.


And I see all my friends doing better than me not necessarily in terms of money but experiences.
I feel like life's passing me by and there isn't much I can do.
So for the past months with the little money I had left around 200 or so
I just drank smoked and gambled to cope.
Gambling part mostly because I'm like well
I don't have enough money to do anything usefull with it so I pray on getting lucky (no luck)

Idk I feel stuck with little option.
I applied to over 300 jobs but, can't get one.
Tbh idk what I should do I'm just overall depressed.
Feels like I'm missing out on life and it really bothers me.
Yk when I see ppl my age doing stuff or making more money I get angry not at them ofc but at myself is not jealousy I think just hatred towards myself bcs I can't do it.

I don't know if what I wrote makes a lot of sense those were just my thoughts so yeah.

Any advice? I don't plan on staying like this forever because if I thought about that I'd kill myself ngl.
But I don't see how I can change it atm at least.

Am I depressed or am I just lazy?,"I’ve been feeling completely clueless about what I want in life because nothing satisfies me anymore. I don’t have any goals, even though everyone around me keeps saying that I should be working towards something at this stage of my life, thinking about my future.

So I searched online for advice, and what I found was: *""Pick anything and try it.""* But whenever I try to start something, this strange feeling rises inside me. It eats away at me and stops me from beginning anything.

Whenever that feeling comes, it brings guilt, but at the same time, it makes me feel like doing nothing at all. It makes me just want to sit and wait to die.

Just moved into a new apartment and feel so depressed…,"So I(F23)4 days ago i moved to a new apartment about 40 min car drive from my old place. It has been a goal of mine to move away from my fathers home for couple of years now since it has been an extremely bad environment.
However, a guy that i was seeing also broke up with me a day after i moved in. Also a fact that he lives now 10 min away from me. 
Now it feels like i do not wanna live in my new apartment and just wanna move somewhere far away. With no one around and kinda just end everything. I already feel lonely enough because i don’t have many friends.
It feels like this journey is making me more depressed than ever and with every hour i feel worse and worse.
Mind you the fact that this is not my home country and have no close family here at all.

It’s so fucking unfair.,"I was born in a shitty country that doesn’t even have proper social systems in place for people need help. My dad is emotionally cold, my mom was straight up physically and emotionally abusive. I grew up depressed and lonely, but I still dreamed of moving abroad doing something awesome with my life.

Fast forward to my twenties, I worked hard and moved to my dream country, got an awesome job. But my messed up brain took everything away from me. 

Thanks to childhood trauma, I can’t relate to people, can’t keep friends, could never even get into a relationship. Memory disorders and aphantasia messed with my ability to be creative. Possible learning disorders I inherited from my mom limited my academic and professional achievement. My depression has killed my ability to just be a functional human. 

I will lose my job soon and move back to the country I hate. No friends, no independence. I can wish all I want for a happy life but my brain is literally incapable of functioning. 

Why do I have to go through this shit? I worked hard and did my best to achieve my dreams. But none of that matters. My messed up brain is a prison I am unable to get out of.

Some people are dealt shitty hands in life, guess I’m one of those people. I just gotta accept that my life will always be shitty. 

It’s so fucking unfair. All I wanted was the ability to choose how I lived life, but now I’ve lost control over everything. I’m living my worst nightmare.

Having worst life,"I feel like I have the worst life, currently I am 25. I am introvert type person. I have always been in fear and afraid of doing things. I am even afraid in riding bicycle. I am not even good at studies. Had completed school some how. I only have 2-3 friends from school only. and hangon with them ocationally. I have never had friendship with girls. I was bullied in school, extremely beaten by teachers. Got easily offended from other classmates jokes and talkings. I had to start my graduation. At that time I was unaware of my interests and long term life goals. Had taken admission in expensive college with my one friend. The degree was just basic graduation. That time Covid had arrived. So I didn't go to college in my entire graduation because of lockdowns.
And in my home I got addicted to movies, web shows,games, porn, masturbation, etc. 
I didn't even go out of home.All money and graduation time had ruined till i realised. I didn't had any practical and soft & communication skills. I got unemployed too with much regret of wasting time and parents money. Then my another friend and me joined an private skills learning institution to get job. There , too i didn't get serious about learning. I used to go to have alcohol, play games, and travel with them. And in home i become god of procrastination till I know. I don't think there's any bigger procrastinator than me. As time passes the skill course time gets over and learnt nothing. I am very skinny and got ugly face. I didn't even fashion and styling knowledge. My parents are unware of my current situation as i didn't tell them.
I don't know my life purpose and what do i want. My friends are enjoying and having all fun and I am just watching them.today I have regrets,money pressure, being unemployed pressure, good fitness pressure, marriage pressure from parents and society, future pressure, not a good son pressure, and many more in mind. I try to change habits but couldn't. Life has become very very hard. I feel like I couldn't handle this pressure more. My phone is also 7 years old and barely works well.

"I thought I was healing. Turns out, I was just surviving."," 
I haven’t been feeling okay. For years I’ve carried this emptiness, this heaviness stuck to my skin like it’s part of me. Three years ago, I had a suicidal crisis. I was hospitalized in a psychiatric care unit. I thought that was rock bottom, that things could only get better from there. But that’s not how it went.

When I got out, there wasn’t really any follow-up. No therapy. No plan. I got a prescription, two or three numbers to call, and was told to take care of myself. I came home with a shattered mind, a box of pills, and duct tape holding me together. I wasn’t healing. I was trying to survive with the scraps I had left.

I stopped working for months. I was drained. Numb. Couldn’t function. I was studying at university while freelancing at the same time, and I just couldn’t keep going. I used up all my savings trying to give myself time to heal. Time to feel better. So I wouldn’t collapse again.

Five months later, my girlfriend left me. A few days later, on my birthday, she told me she was pregnant… and didn’t want to keep it. I wasn’t ready. That hit me right when I had no footing left. I tried to be there for her. She went through a complicated ectopic pregnancy and I did my best to support her. But honestly, I was already drowning in silence.

Two weeks after my birthday, I took a job as a maintenance worker in a private school. Three months later, I got accepted into a housing co-op. The rent was super low and with my salary, I couldn’t afford anything else. I needed a fresh start. I moved about an hour away from where I had lived all my life. Found another maintenance job, this time in a public school. Then in summer 2023, just three months in, I got promoted to a management role. It was a position in a field I really cared about. One I had dreamed of for years. I had stopped believing it could happen.

I gave everything to that job. I threw myself into it day and night. I worked six days a week, often more than ten hours a day. Too much responsibility, no real support. I tried to raise red flags, but the environment turned toxic. And I absorbed it.

I took a short medical leave this past spring. Just two weeks. When I came back, my direct supervisor criticized me for taking time off. It hit me hard. I felt ashamed, guilty. A few days later, I met with HR. They asked how I was doing. I told them about the pressure, the stress, the burnout. Their answer? That nothing would get better, and the workload would only increase next year. I was crushed. I expected support. I needed to feel heard. Instead, I felt like I was the problem. Like I was just a pawn. And this was coming from a place that claims to value people and inclusion. Yeah, right. I started falling apart again.

Things went downhill fast. I stopped sleeping well. My anxiety came back all at once. I started having weird thoughts. Subtle paranoia, like people were watching me, like everyone was against me. I know it’s not rational, but I feel it anyway. My thoughts are all jumbled, scattered. I’m afraid I’m slipping back into the psychosis I went through three years ago. I need real care. Not just pills. A real plan. A follow-up.

I asked for help. My doctor put me on medical leave in April. Just thinking about going back takes the air out of my lungs. I’m empty. I’m not in a place to make big decisions. I’m not even able to take care of myself. I’m just here. Frozen.

From mid-April until around the end of May or early June, I was kind of “functional.” I even picked up some hobbies again, like carving. I wish I could say the meds helped me feel better. But that’s not the truth.

I feel crushed. No motivation. I leave my room to eat and that’s about it. I’ve lost interest in the things that used to bring me peace. I don’t go outside anymore because just the idea of seeing someone or interacting with someone freezes me in place. I don’t answer calls, texts, or deal with obligations because it forces me to face reality. I can’t. I’m paralyzed.

In my head, there’s a fight between a small voice that’s tired of suffering and my reason, which still says maybe the sky will clear and the sun will shine again. I’m holding on to that hope, at least for now. Living with this pain in my soul forever… that can’t be what life is about.

I’m not the person I used to be, and I can’t make peace with what’s left. I used to be lit up. Curious. Present. I had goals, passions, connection. Now I’m just a shell. Time passes and I’m not even really here. I disappear from people’s lives, without a sound.

I don’t talk to my long-time friends anymore. Not because I don’t care. Because I don’t know how to be around anyone. Shame eats me alive. Guilt crushes me. I don’t know how to stand in front of people who really know me. It’s the same with my family. I love them, without a doubt. But I’ve shut down. How can I maintain healthy relationships when I’ve stopped loving myself?

There’s a voice in my head that won’t shut up. It criticizes everything, tears me down, makes me doubt. Usually, reason would step in. Remind me it’s just a thought, not truth. But now… that filter is gone. Or worn out. Or too tired. And the voice gets through. It takes up all the space. It becomes my narrator. The more it speaks, the more I disappear.

Even little things reveal how broken I feel. Every time I call someone, the first thing I ask is, “am I bothering you?” That’s not just a habit. It’s something I’ve carried since I was a kid. Always feeling like I take up too much space just by existing. Like I’m a burden by default.

That feeling has been there since childhood. That sense of being forgotten. Like the little boy with a suitcase, waiting for someone who never came. The kid who heard “not now, I’m busy” too many times. The one who learned to stay quiet, to keep his distance, to push people away before they could hurt him. The one who built armor not to be strong, but to be alone, because it felt safer.

I think I grew up never really feeling like I belonged. Never feeling seen. Never feeling like I mattered. I tried to build an identity through achievements, through performance. I wanted to shine so I’d be loved. But inside, I was falling apart.

And now… I’m still here. Barely. But here. Trying not to sink any deeper. Trying to exist, one breath at a time. I’m exhausted. My soul hurts. So deeply.",6,2025-07-05 02:07:35,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1lrz5ai/i_thought_i_was_healing_turns_out_i_was_just/,i thought i was healing turns out i was just surviving,i havent

i couldnt afford anything else i needed a fresh start i moved about an hour away from where i had lived all my life found another maintenance job this time in a public school then in summer 2023 just three months in i got promoted to a management role it was a position in a field i really cared about one i had dreamed of for years i had stopped believing it could happen i gave everything to that job i threw myself into it day and night i worked six days a week often more than ten hours a day too much responsibility no real support i tried to raise red flags but the environment turned toxic and i absorbed it i took a short medical leave this past spring just two weeks when i came back my direct supervisor criticized me for taking time off it hit me hard i felt ashamed guilty a few days later i met with hr they asked how i was doing i told them about the pressure the stress the burnout their answer that nothing would get better and the workload would only increase next year i was crushed i expected support i needed to feel heard instead i felt like i was the problem like i was just a pawn and this was coming from a place that claims to value people and inclusion yeah right i started falling apart again things went downhill fast i stopped sleeping well my anxiety came back all at once i started having weird thoughts subtle paranoia like people were watching me like everyone was against me i know its not rational but i feel it anyway my thoughts are all jumbled scattered im afraid im slipping back into the psychosis i went through three years ago i need real care not just pills a real plan a followup i asked for help my doctor put me on medical leave in april just thinking about going back takes the air out of my lungs im empty im not in a place to make big decisions im not even able to take care of myself im just here frozen from midapril until around the end of may or early june i was kind of functional i even picked up some hobbies again like carving i wish i could say the meds helped me feel better but thats not the truth i feel crushed no motivation i leave my room to eat and thats about it ive lost interest in the things that used to bring me peace i dont go outside anymore because just the idea of seeing someone or interacting with someone freezes me in place i dont answer calls texts or deal with obligations because it forces me to face reality i cant im paralyzed in my head theres a fight between a small voice thats tired of suffering and my reason which still says maybe the sky will clear and the sun will shine again im holding on to that hope at least for now living with this pain in my soul forever that cant be what life is about im not the person i used to be and i cant make peace with whats left i used to be lit up curious present i had goals passions connection now im just a shell time passes and im not even really here i disappear from peoples lives without a sound i dont talk to my longtime friends anymore not because i dont care because i dont know how to be around anyone shame eats me alive guilt crushes me i dont know how to stand in front of people who really know me its the same with my family i love them without a doubt but ive shut down how can i maintain healthy relationships when ive stopped loving myself theres a voice in my head that wont shut up it criticizes everything tears me down makes me doubt usually reason would step in remind me its just a thought not truth but now that filter is gone or worn out or too tired and the voice gets through it takes up all the space it becomes my narrator the more it speaks the more i disappear even little things reveal how broken i feel every time i call someone the first thing i ask is am i bothering you thats not just a habit its something ive carried since i was a kid always feeling like i take up too much space just by existing like im a burden by default that feeling has been there since childhood that sense of being forgotten like the little boy with a suitcase waiting for someone who never came the kid who heard not now im busy too many times the one who learned to stay quiet to keep his distance to push people away before they could hurt him the one who built armor not to be strong but to be alone because it felt safer i think i grew up never really feeling like i belonged never feeling seen never feeling like i mattered i tried to build an identity through achievements through performance i wanted to shine so id be loved but inside i was falling apart and now im still here barely but here trying not to sink any deeper trying to exist one breath at a time im exhausted my soul hurts so deeply
"Last night, my world fell apart.","Let me give you a bit of background first: I have a deep hatred for cigarettes – and for smoking in general. That feeling stems from a personal loss: my father was a heavy smoker and died of cancer when I was still young. Ever since, smoking has been tied in my mind to pain, grief, and loss.

When I met my wife, she was a smoker. But about five and a half years ago, she quit and I couldn’t have been prouder. Unfortunately, I later found out that she had secretly started smoking again – long before we got married. She only confessed it to me after the wedding.

To be honest: if there’s one thing I hate more than smoking, it’s being lied to. And this lie – the months of secrecy – broke something inside me. Our relationship spiraled into arguments, mistrust, and sleepless nights. I had recurring nightmares – visions of us having children, only for me to end up raising them alone.

I’ll admit, I wasn’t exactly kind during those conversations. I was harsh, maybe even cold. But I was never violent. I just couldn’t understand how someone I trusted so deeply could betray me like that. Of all people I know, she was the only person I ever truly opened up to.

What I didn’t know then was that, during that time, she had been growing closer to one of her coworkers, someone she had already been in touch with before the confession. Afterward, their contact intensified. Apparently, even I – my bluntness and my behavior – had become a topic between them.

In January (she told me this just last night) they ended up sleeping together. It developed into a kind of secret relationship, which she claims was more about talking than physical contact. But they were chatting constantly, even during moments that feel like a punch to the gut – like on the anniversary of my father’s death or while I sat right next to her.

This went on for months – until yesterday. Her coworker apparently threatened to tell me everything. Out of fear that I’d hear it from him, she decided to confess it herself.

I’m devastated.

She was the only person I truly trusted. I’ve struggled with trust issues for years and now she’s shattered the last bit of it I had left. I sat there, getting drunk, barely able to process what she was saying, listening to her sob through her confession.

I barely even respond. I was completely numb.

What hurts even more is the hypocrisy. She’s been vocal in condemning others for this kind of behavior. The irony is almost cruel: around 10–15 years ago, her own mother did something similar to her father. The resulting depression nearly killed him. My wife was old enough to understand what happened and even cut ties with her mother for a time after the divorce.

And now here we are. She’s sitting at home. I’m at work. And I hate everything about my life right now.

I feel completely overwhelmed and lost. I don’t know how to move forward. And the truth is... I have no one else to turn to.",2,2025-07-05 08:55:29,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ls5h93/last_night_my_world_fell_apart/,last night my world fell apart,let me give you a bit of background first i have a deep hatred for cigarettes and for smoking in general that feeling stems from a personal loss my father was a heavy smoker and died of cancer when i was still young ever since smoking has been tied in my mind to pain grief and loss when i met my wife she was a smoker but about five and a half years ago she quit and i couldnt have been prouder unfortunately i later found out that she had secretly started smoking again long before we got married she only confessed it to me after the wedding to be honest if theres one thing i hate more than smoking its being lied to and this lie the months of secrecy broke something inside me our relationship spiraled into arguments mistrust and sleepless nights i had recurring nightmares visions of us having children only for me to end up raising them alone ill admit i wasnt exactly kind during those conversations i was harsh maybe even cold but i was never violent i just couldnt understand how someone i trusted so deeply could betray me like that of all people i know she was the only person i ever truly opened up to what i didnt know then was that during that time she had been growing closer to one of her coworkers someone she had already been in touch with before the confession afterward their contact intensified apparently even i my bluntness and my behavior had become a topic between them in january she told me this just last night they ended up sleeping together it developed into a kind of secret relationship which she claims was more about talking than physical contact but they were chatting constantly even during moments that feel like a punch to the gut like on the anniversary of my fathers death or while i sat right next to her this went on for months until yesterday her coworker apparently threatened to tell me everything out of fear that id hear it from him she decided to confess it herself im devastated she was the only person i truly trusted ive struggled with trust issues for years and now shes shattered the last bit of it i had left i sat there getting drunk barely able to process what she was saying listening to her sob through her confession i barely even respond i was completely numb what hurts even more is the hypocrisy shes been vocal in condemning others for this kind of behavior the irony is almost cruel around 1015 years ago her own mother did something similar to her father the resulting depression nearly killed him my wife was old enough to understand what happened and even cut ties with her mother for a time after the divorce and now here we are shes sitting at home im at work and i hate everything about my life right now i feel completely overwhelmed and lost i dont know how to move forward and the truth is i have no one else to turn to

most documented cases of suicide,"I mean are there are any cases where the person who ended up committing suicide was either very outspoken, or had written a lot in journals or a blog or something.

It feels like every choice I can make is wrong,"I'm in college and I just started a part time job on the weekends that I'm already regretting after a few weeks. It's hard on my body and even though I'm only 22, it feels like I'm going to need knee replacements in a couple years at this rate. I'm always achy and lately have been getting headaches almost daily. 

I think the headaches are just fatigue. I was officially diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia (narcolepsy) close to a year ago but have been on medication for it for about 3-4 years now. Sometimes, like tonight, I get so anxious that I won't wake up in the morning that it keeps me from sleeping. 

I've slept through so many alarms and disappointed people (and myself) enough times that I'm afraid to go to sleep when I'm extremely tired, which is when I need sleep the most, but is also when I go into deep sleeps that make it really hard to wake me up. 

It feels like I only have energy to do one thing a day, and even then it's too much. It's impossible to take care of myself properly when I'm so tired after school or work. I don't get much time to do things that I enjoy, and when I make time I just feel guilty that it's taking away from sleep, showering, chores, etc. 

I honestly don't know if quitting this job will even help. I dread it every weekend but I didn't get enough from my student loan to live off of and I just feel worse and worse every time I move money out of my savings account. 

Nothing feels like a good choice. I wish I didn't have to get out of bed anymore. I've been pushing myself for the past 2 years, working to save some money and now in school. It never ends. I'll have to work until the day I die and I'll always be tired. Everything is so overwhelming.

The TimeCop,"Imagine you were told that in five years, you would be arrested by a time traveling cop. By the capacity the cop has, there is no way you can escape being arrested. You are also told you have two choices. You can accept the sentence and spend the rest of your time behind bars, or do something so impossible that you escape the sentence.

That’s what my depression feels like sometimes. It hits me and I either just sit there stuck with it or come up with these solutions in my head that are not going to happen.

Any advice on living with depression? Does it get better down the line?,"Hi everyone! I'm 21f and have been diagnosed with depression for 2 years now. I thought it was situational, since I got diagnosed after some events happened to me. I've been on meds since I got diagnosed and thought that I was better for almost a year now but I just got done with a major depressive episode. 

This episode made me realize it wasn't situational, but it was chronic. It makes me feel so bad, I already hated the fact that I'd have to live with this and be on meds for it but now it'll just come randomly too and it fucking sucks ass. I thought I was genuinely okay until my girlfriend told me that I needed help (I was in fact not doing okay). I can see it now that I was in an episode, but while I was in it I was blind asf.

I'm going back to the gym, picking up hobbies again that I had stopped, and feeling better now. Also I am in therapy but currently looking for a new therapist and will be taking to my doc about switching meds.

not feeling good about myself,"I am a dude who just graduated high school. for years now since the 9th grade i have been consistently sad and gloomy. there are those good moments where i'm with friends and it's a good day, or when this girl i have no chance with that i have been crushing on since the 6th grade sends me a snap or this girl I went to prom with that said she had fun with me and I got thrown for a loop. But even on those good days I'll come home and most of the time it will be like a wave just brought me from the surface of the water where I was happy, down below to where I'm questioning my importance. It's not like i have a bad life either. My parents love me very much and never hesitate to help me when I need it. My friends are great and I know they love me as I love them no matter how many arab or fat jokes they throw at me (and i come back with something targeted at them). The only downsides of my life is that I do wish my parents made more and my dad stopped trying so many different things, and I wish i took care of myself throughout high school and was in shape so that the girl I went to prom with didn't look like she lost a bet (way out of my league but my friend is the best wingman oat). Sometimes I get out the shower and see myself in the reflection and get pissed just seeing the shape I'm in.

Recently I have been having thoughts of suicide and also writing a notes to my loved ones saying that it is not at all their fault, and to leave special messages to my 2 best friends. I think about the best way for someone to find my body as to not burden them with that sight. I think these thoughts come from the fact I never think I am good enough for people. I try to fight that feeling with doing nice things for people, like when I worked at McDonald's, some homeless dude was at the store around the time we close the inside, but the shelter was not doing pick up at that time, so i called him a cab and gave the cabbie $40 and to keep the change (it was Christmas time in the Maritimes so around -20°C i was not going to let some homeless dude freeze outside).

Life only gets worse,"„Life gets better“ is a freaking lie. I can say that from experience now. At least, even if it does, only for a short time. But after than, it’s only worse. I‘ve struggled strongly with mental illness, mostly depression since I was a child, and I already thought back then that it couldn’t get worse, I was already sewerslidal back then. But god, how was I wrong. The more time passes, the more ways life finds to f me up. Adulthood doesn’t just suck, it’s my ruin, and not just in my head, in all damn ways. When I was thinking „ I want to be gone by  18“ I was damn right. And now I’m supposed to be more stable? Now people don’t show me any empathy or understanding anymore? When now it is so much worse than in my teens but just because I’m technically an adult, no one gives an f anymore.

Thinking hurts.,"I know what this place is. It’s just an echo chamber. I know it won’t help me to post here, but what can I do? It’s the only place I could think of to be heard or seen or at least get sone stranger on the internet to give a shit about me. 

I hate this. I really do think that I should have never been born. I can’t kill myself. A part of me still wants to see where this life takes me. I can’t give up here, but all I feel is pain. In my body, in my brain, and in every single atom of my body. 

I knew life was going to be hard. I know I don’t have it as badly as anyone else, but I have to speak. I have to scream at the void, hoping that something will just yell back. To let me know that I’m not alone on this shit planet. 

I miss him, but I’m too stubborn to reach out. I’m too stubborn to reach out to anyone. All I want to do is disappear. To not be a burden for anyone. All I do is take people for granted. Then they get tired, angry, or annoyed. They leave me. Everyone leaves me, and for the ones I don’t, I just attack them because of my ungratefulness. 

I never deserved anyone’s hand, heart, or comfort. But I still long for it. I still long for someone to see me. I want someone to be mine. But I can’t pretend to love somebody. I can’t use people like I always do. I’ll just be alone then. Like I always have been. It was what was set in stone.

Mistake. I thought if I was completely honest with myself about myself I could find away to be better. I was wrong.,"Being completely honest with myself about who I am and what I represent would help me become a better person and find happiness. I thoroughly examined all my faults including moral, ethical, physical, and others. It took a year to truly identify them all. However, this process has left me deeply unhappy, with a profound sense of self-loathing and a complete loss of confidence. I see no positive prospects for my future and feel trapped with no clear way forward. I do not believe in suicide, which leaves me feeling stuck, lacking any real motivation to live.

Humiliation,"Hello. I recently picked up playing poker with my girlfriend and her father(who is a professional) and last night I kind of messed up betting chips and screwed up the whole hand, ended up folding even tho I had a winning hand just because of how ashamed I felt as everyone at the table was watching and reacted as if I was dumb. This sent me into a negative train of thought which I am currently stuck in. It feels like her dad only wants me to play so he can show how much better he is than me and I’m stuck in a less than position.

A little over a month ago I was kicked off my work crew. I worked as a wildland firefighter for 5 years and I began having panic attacks while getting yelled at on our PT hikes. While on our way up to a fire the guy in charge of me saw I had began to struggle and began laying into me. I froze up and was removed from the crew, I had spent every day with  that particular crew for 2 seasons (6 months each) and I had to go in front of them and take all my stuff off the truck and clear all my things from the station while everyone was watching. I tried really hard to do well and I wouldn’t have even done that job anymore but they had asked me to come back this year. I shouldn’t have listened to them but I’m a people pleaser so that’s what happened. I felt like of one of the guys in charge really got off  putting me down and enjoyed having me humiliated in front of the crew as much as he could. 

My recent poker mishap just pulled up all these other recent memories. 

I’m getting older almost 40, never really found my niche professionally now I’m going to have to start over again. I got an EMT certification to try and help my fire career so I applied to be on an ambulance but I feel like I’m just setting myself up to be humiliated again in a high pressure situation as I’ll be the new stupid guy. 

I feel like in social situations  it often happens that people are not happy unless they are able to dominate me and it’s not fair because I feel happiest when I’m just one of the group. I’m tired of being treated as less than. This might be because I’m a bigger guy and people feel intimidated so they have to assert themselves when I would much rather be left alone. 

When I am like this I like to be alone but last year I got a girlfriend for the first time in years and now she’s mad at me because I want to be alone. I don’t know what to do, I didn’t ask to be here.

it’s so easy to tell people you’re okay. well honestly, it’s easier than having a hard time explaining why you feel empty these days. because damn, i wouldn’t know what to tell them. i, myself, also don’t know why do i feel this way.

it’s not my fault for feeling this way. but anyway, seeing them feel good while pretending to be okay is kind of sad too. it kind of makes me build higher walls to keep my depression hidden. the more i pretend, the more i realize how my depression just keeps inconveniencing people. 

the setback is, everyday, i feel like rotting from the inside. but oh well, when have i ever lived for myself anyway. maybe i’m just born to be like this.

Losing interest in everything,"It’s been rough recently. I have Bipolar Disorder  (type 1) and am calming from a hypomanic episode. That usually isn’t super bad, but for some reason, the following depression has been near crippling.

All I can think about is my shortcomings. I think about my lost childhood and my broken life so far. I think about taking my own life sometimes.

Along with that, I don’t do anything anymore, I don’t want to, it’s too much for me. I don’t go out, I don’t socialize, I don’t play music, and I don’t draw. I can’t anymore, it’s just too depressing when all I can think about is my own shortcomings in that field. 

Can anyone please help or give advice?? I just want to sit down and draw for an hour, blissfully happy and ignorant of my horrible life.

Not sure if I'm the only one but I hate that even though I'm aware of my depression it doesn't make it better,"I'm 20 years old and I've had depression for almost 5 years now. It was first diagnosed 3 years ago and I thought I got better but surprise surprise it only got worse. I barely graduated and tbh it's a miracle I did with me missing school for almost 1 entire month. 

Over these 5 years I read a lot about how to deal with depression, 2 years ago had some talks in a walk-in-Therapy (idk how they're called)  where I got diagnosed and got my prescription. Obviously I still am no expert about it but it's tiring to see what's happening to me and knowing how it all works but still not being able to change anything. 

[TRIGGER WARNING] : SELF-HARM, SUICIDE (I'm new to this subreddit and I'm not sure if it's alright to mention this so I apologise in advance if I should've posted this somewhere else) 

Even back then 4 years ago I started Cutting my forearm with a razorblade. And when I do it it's almost as if I'm just a passenger in my own body or as if I'm just an observer and I know that it isn't a healthy coping mechanism but I still do it. Recently it got worse with me starting to cut shallow cuts on my neck close to my carotid artery. 

I also had in those last 5 years 3 different suicide attempts. The first one being right in the morning of my 18th birthday where I had my letter written, made sure no one was home  at the time I would do it and all I needed to do is buy a gun to end it. But turns out I didn't even have enough energy to go outside and buy it and that's how I spent my entire 18th birthday on my bed. 

My second attempt was a year and a half later when I locked myself in our bathroom after everyone went to sleep, took a razorblade and instead of just cutting like I usually did, I felt around for the radial artery, pushed the blade deep into the skin and I wanted to just rip it. But I hesitated, cleaned the wound and went to bed. 

My third attempt was about 4 weeks ago after my depression had relapsed and I started cutting a bit deeper than usual on my neck. But still somehow I hesitated. 

What im trying to say is that I know what I'm doing isn't healthy. (I mean duh!). I know if I kill myself my friends will miss me. My little brother who is himself dealing with a lot and coping with alcohol and maybe even drugs will get even worse. I know my mother would never stop blaming herself. I mean even at my first attempt I knew all that and I already tried 3 different times.

Also you'd think that I'm a danger to myself so maybe we should prevent me from having  access to things I can hurt myself with right? Guess what? I can't sleep unless I have a knife next to my bed. It isn't logical at all. But everytime I think I hear something in our house I grab a knife or some scissors and check every room in our house for anything.

I still have so much more that is wrong with me but if i continue I'd start talking about stuff that probably has less to do with this subreddit. 

Sorry for my long rant but I'm curious if I'm the only one

Tired,"Depression has been with me since childhood. At times it'd linger in the shadows always waiting to reappear. There has been seasons when I thought the wheel was turning, it was going to be my turn for happiness, peace. But things kept happening in life, the weight kept piling on an already tired body. Some were in my control but A LOT were not like the death of my loved ones, growing up around abusive relationships with added addictions the people I loved faced, people I loved abandoning our relationship. I guess my question is how do you overcome this beast when you are already emotionally spent?

How to Manage?,"I was recently diagnosed with moderate depression by my psychiatrist, figured something was wrong when I would come home from school and have absolutely no motivation to do anything. Constantly procrastinating on homework, purposely staying up for as long as possible (because having the extra time makes me feel better(?) though I would literally do nothing with that time), and eventually I would just skip all my self-care habits and days of school. Now I'm hoping to get my medicine and until then I would like to hold on to hope that it would magically cure all my issues. I don't really feel sad or anything, in fact I think I act pretty normal around people in public. For a long time, I actually thought It was some sort of laziness that just clouded over me or continuous bad habits that got out of hand. It's progressed to where, every day, I just feel numb and apathetic with absolutely no motivation to do anything. I used to go on walks finding some semblance of satisfaction in connecting routes or feeling some sort of progress when I've done nothing all day, but now it's just repetitive and annoying. High School might be some of the worst times to hit depression. I've had long term goals that I've ended, standards I've fallen short of, aspirations I've seen friends and peers achieve. It quite literally feels like I'm watching time move, yet there's no urgency at all anymore, just acceptance and simultaneously guilt? It's Fourth of July today and normally I would go out and look at the fireworks, but today I'm too lazy even for that... 

Now I know medicine won't completely transform my incredibly unhealthy lifestyle. but until I actually receive it, how do I pull it together and actually be productive? How do I just force myself out of this? How can I make goals for myself and actually care to achieve them? How can I not be afraid to have hope for once? I feel like I've failed everyone and completely regret the past year. How do I get out of it?

I'm depressed,"I feel more depressed now than I ever have before. Every day, I consider suicide, but I'm far too scared to do it.

Every morning before work, I tell myself that I'll clean my bedroom after work. I never do. My floor is so covered in garbage and food and clothes that I dread entering my room. I walk across my bed just to get to my desk, where I spend most of my freetime. 

Today is a holiday in the US. I woke up early and went to my grandparents' house. My mom and cousins were there. Then later I went to see a concert with somebody from work. The whole day, all I wanted was to go home and sit at my desk. Yet once I did get home, I felt just as bad as I did earlier. 

I don't really like my family, so we rarely talk. I ignore most calls and texts I get from them. I don't have friends. The invite to go to a concert today was the first time I saw somebody outside of work in months. 

When I do talk to my roommates or to my family, I feel like a worse person. I feel like everybody around me has their shit figured out. Everybody except me. 

I can't find the motivation to go for walks anymore. I don't know how to find a therapist. I'm scared to do therapy because if I tell them how suicidal I am, I'm sure I'll be send up a looney bin.

I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I've just been fighting a battle I can't win my whole life. I'm tired of fighting just to fail.

I wasn't having bad thoughts or being depressed in the slightest.....but for some reason tonight, on the fourth of July, sitting next to my family is when I started thinking ""would they miss me"" that started me down a spiral, on the drive back to my apartment (it's dark out) I'm just driving, listening to depressing music, getting an itch, an itch I haven't felt in a long time, an itch to hurt my self, it could just be by scraping my skin with objects or it could be cutting, I just wanted to do something.  A few times I thought how nice it would be to just close my eyes and let go of the steering wheel...just to have it all end.

People always say, ""You've come this far, you should be proud."" But I'm not proud, I'm not proud that I'm still alive. I wish I had the courage to end this a few years ago, but now I'm just dragging my existence. I don't see myself in the future. I don't see my future. I haven't believed in anything I used to dream about for a long time. I don't even want things to get better, I just want it to end. I have no friends, and my girlfriend is thousands of kilometers away from me in another city, and there is no guarantee that we will ever meet. 
I am still in this world only because of my parents and girlfriend, but I'm suffering. I want so much to just leave this world, but I know that my parents and my girlfriend will suffer if I do this. I'm trapped. I feel terrible in this world, I want to kill myself quickly and painlessly, but pity for my parents and girlfriend does not allow me to do it. 
I have no desire to do anything. I just lie on the bed most of the time and eat (sometimes). And I don't even want to get out of bed, I don't even want to wake up. I can go a week without brushing my teeth or washing myself. I just feel like nothing matters.
Death for me is freedom, I want to be free so much. I feel that I do not belong to this world, that I am unwanted here. All the people around me... are wrong. Everything around me is wrong. I don't want anything anymore, I just want to disappear, for it all to end.",2,2025-07-05 02:47:24,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1lrzt5f/i_really_want_this_all_to_end/,i really want this all to end,my depression has been going on since 2021 around 2023 for months i was sure i was going to kill myself i should have done it then people always say youve come this far you should be proud but im not proud im not proud that im still alive i wish i had the courage to end this a few years ago but now im just dragging my existence i dont see myself in the future i dont see my future i havent believed in anything i used to dream about for a long time i dont even want things to get better i just want it to end i have no friends and my girlfriend is thousands of kilometers away from me in another city and there is no guarantee that we will ever meet i am still in this world only because of my parents and girlfriend but im suffering i want so much to just leave this world but i know that my parents and my girlfriend will suffer if i do this im trapped i feel terrible in this world i want to kill myself quickly and painlessly but pity for my parents and girlfriend does not allow me to do it i have no desire to do anything i just lie on the bed most of the time and eat sometimes and i dont even want to get out of bed i dont even want to wake up i can go a week without brushing my teeth or washing myself i just feel like nothing matters death for me is freedom i want to be free so much i feel that i do not belong to this world that i am unwanted here all the people around me are wrong everything around me is wrong i dont want anything anymore i just want to disappear for it all to end
How I’m feeling right now - depression poetry,"When will someone be willing to “fix me?”

Why is it always one mistake and it’s over. That’s why I’ve never learned, no one’s given me a chance to. Please just tell me what to do differently and I will listen, with no pushback. I might explain my perspective but that’s only so you can try to see my side, not because I’m defending myself.

I screw everything up but I don’t think that means that I don’t deserve a second chance. I’m a human being.

Just because I cry and react, doesn’t mean I’m not dead inside. I am.

How many fresh starts do I have to have before I find someone who’s willing to give me a second chance?

I wish people would tell me they didn’t want me anymore and then allow me to tell them that I understand and then thank them for their impact on my life.",3,2025-07-05 00:32:20,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1lrxj1m/how_im_feeling_right_now_depression_poetry/,how im feeling right now depression poetry,when will someone be willing to fix me why is it always one mistake and its over thats why ive never learned no ones given me a chance to please just tell me what to do differently and i will listen with no pushback i might explain my perspective but thats only so you can try to see my side not because im defending myself i screw everything up but i dont think that means that i dont deserve a second chance im a human being just because i cry and react doesnt mean im not dead inside i am how many fresh starts do i have to have before i find someone whos willing to give me a second chance i wish people would tell me they didnt want me anymore and then allow me to tell them that i understand and then thank them for their impact on my life

I hate my family,"Hi I'm teenage girl and i have a really deep hatred for my family. I have a twin sister and fro the moment I can remember she has beeen the star of the show. she was born prettier than me, we are not identicle, everyone adored how cute and outgoing he was, in contrast I was always ugly and unsociable. What angers me the most is the fact that there favouritism isnt even justified, I graduated top of my country and got multiple scholoships while shes busy chasing grown men, I've always been known for being well behaved while she causes constant problems. My mother gets angry at me for things she does and often takes whatever feelings she has towards my sister out on me. today she asked me to get something from the garden and a frog jumped on me, I naturally feaked out and she slapped me cause of said freak out. I was so confused and hurt because lately we had been bonding and all of a sudden she's slapping me cause I was scared of a frog. When I asked her politely why she did that she then began beating me. I'm so tired of getting beat of by my mom, I'm tired of my fucking siter getting all they attention. I'm tired of my dad never doing anything and never being around and I'm tired of being alone. I have no friends I spent all my life trying to impress the very same people who don't care about me and isolated myself from others, I regret never trying harder to meet new people I regret always staying in the corner. I'm meek and shy and now no matter how hard I try I just can't interact with new folks. I'll be going to college next September and I really hope this will be a good opportunity for me to male friends. yeah I was just looking for a way to get my feelings out I don't think any advice would work since this is a situation I can't seem to get out of but thanks anyways.",3,2025-07-05 00:19:57,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1lrxau0/i_hate_my_family/,i hate my family,hi im teenage girl and i have a really deep hatred for my family i have a twin sister and fro the moment i can remember she has beeen the star of the show she was born prettier than me we are not identicle everyone adored how cute and outgoing he was in contrast i was always ugly and unsociable what angers me the most is the fact that there favouritism isnt even justified i graduated top of my country and got multiple scholoships while shes busy chasing grown men ive always been known for being well behaved while she causes constant problems my mother gets angry at me for things she does and often takes whatever feelings she has towards my sister out on me today she asked me to get something from the garden and a frog jumped on me i naturally feaked out and she slapped me cause of said freak out i was so confused and hurt because lately we had been bonding and all of a sudden shes slapping me cause i was scared of a frog when i asked her politely why she did that she then began beating me im so tired of getting beat of by my mom im tired of my fucking siter getting all they attention im tired of my dad never doing anything and never being around and im tired of being alone i have no friends i spent all my life trying to impress the very same people who dont care about me and isolated myself from others i regret never trying harder to meet new people i regret always staying in the corner im meek and shy and now no matter how hard i try i just cant interact with new folks ill be going to college next september and i really hope this will be a good opportunity for me to male friends yeah i was just looking for a way to get my feelings out i dont think any advice would work since this is a situation i cant seem to get out of but thanks anyways
Holidays Are The Worst,"Especially on social media.

And I feel like I can't talk about it with anyone, because I've been low for so long, that I feel that I've run out of chances/goodwill/help. I just want a hamburger and to escape my silly life.

"Want some outside perspectives, unsure how to title this","Cross posted with another group to try to get as much help as I can.

I'm 27M, have battled depression and anxiety since middle school, finally accepted help this year and am currently seeing a therapist weekly/bi weekly, have diagnosed ADHD since I was in elementary school, and am strongly suspected of having ASD but am undiagnosed due to wait times for an evaluation. I'm on Zoloft and concerta. Just some relevant background.

I've been finding lately, especially since my birthday this year in February, that I am feeling completely foreign in my own life. Nothing feels the same anymore. The dynamic of my life is gone. Core memories and experiences don't mean the same or have changed in importance. I have no clue who I even am anymore and am having increasing difficulty interacting genuinely with others including family. I'm almost embarrassed with how shitty I act around others. I'm not a dick or stand offish, I just kind of don't even have the mental energy to fully participate anymore. I'm being told a lot of my problems I have with myself are never going to get fixed due to my underlying conditions. I'm supposed to be finally getting help and stop trying to do this on my own. But I increasingly feel more like the above and feel I'm close to loosing control of myself. I don't know what a mental break is or looks like, but I feel like there's something inside me I'm battling for control of myself and thoughts. And right now I'm starting to loose my battle. I'm freaking out. I'm scared, frustrated, and extremely distressed over this. Daily anxiety attacks. At the very least how do I talk about this with my therapist? What should this be defined as/called?

I have finally opened up to my parents,"I am gonna get right into the topic without much story, I opened up to my parents about how I felt, as long as I can remember I've been struggling with depression alongside with other disorders for about..6 years now, I've tried to pretend I was happy as much as I can but it can only came as far, as today I felt deep suicidal thoughts for the 2nd time. I was so afraid of opening up... I couldn't take it anymore because I've felt so miserable to the point that I completely lost love for everything I did in my life to ever enjoy. I just started speaking about it one by one, I wasn't planning on crying but it just happened. I even told about how ugly I've felt everyday. Anyway I felt so vulnerable because it's not something I generally do, I hate getting emotional. My parents understood very well, they said I can beat this and I have the capacity to fight with it and all that other inspirational stuff. I just wanted to say people out there with appreciative parents or family, tell them. I know how hard it is, I was trying to hide it for 6 years or maybe even more but you're only going to be more miserable.

I'm going crazy,"I'm going crazy believing that my depression is a lie constructed by me. I feel like killing myself every day and am unable to feel any emotions towards anything in my life. Waking up is the hardest. I'm also in a relationship and I'm convinced now that I'm making my depression up. Every time I have an attack or breakdown, I am reminded that I don't have any real issues in my life. This is all fake. It's making me scared to even visit a therapist in case they diagnose me as a pathological liar. 

But at the same time, it's causing real world problems. I'm unable to feel any empathy towards people I should care about. And every day, my will to live is dwindling. I don't even care about planning a suicide. I keep imagining and now dreaming of myself jumping in the traffic while crossing the street. But if I try to make my bf understand, he doesn't take me seriously. He thinks there has to be a reason. And I'm convinced again that I'm making it up

Afternoon Slump vs. Depression,"So I have already been diagnosed with Other Specified Depressive Disorder but my doctor didn't know I only get depressed a few hours to 2 days every so often. I am starting to wonder whether or not I really am depressed or if I am just experiencing the afternoon slump. Here are my symptoms.

1. Fatigue/Leaden Paralysis.
2. Low energy.
3. Anhedonia.
4. Hypersomnia (sometimes).

The other symptoms I gave my doctor, such as low self-esteem, are sometimes not present during these phases of ""depression"". Has anyone else been confused about this or do you think its obvious when you are depressed vs. getting low energy triggered by something else. I am starting to wonder if I have just been a dumbass this whole time and maybe I am not depressed after all.

My partner is depressed.,"Hi! Me and my partner are both 17 and recently, we had a small argument about how he felt like i was slowly getting too attached to him in an unhealthy way (anxious style attachment) and we wanted a bit of space from me to recover.

  
Some time after, he realized he had depression. He admitted that he was losing spark in our relationship because it was even harder to deal with his thoughts & himself. He is spending more time now with his friends and I am glad he is doing that because it's helping him cheer up, even for a moment.

  
Days later, he told me he still couldn't find it in himself to bring back his spark for me. I told him the spark wouldn't come back unless he heals himself. When he's out of his dark place, I told him that spark will naturally follow.

Right now, I am trying to remind myself that this space should not be about me, I shouldn't be overthinking. It should be about him. It's hard, but I am staying by his side throughout the process because he deserves enduring love & support, especially at this time. He is the sweetest soul ever and it breaks my heart to witness him through this.

hyperventilating over depressive thoughts,"i can’t really determine if i had a anxiety or panic attack or neither but an hour ago i started hyperventilating over my loneliness and depressive thoughts. i couldn’t breathe for some minutes and all i could think about was how i have no one to talk to about how i truly feel, how i wanted to binge eat (i calorie count and deal with occasional binge eating and recently with my depressive episodes they’ve gotten harder to fight off) how i want to kill myself, how much i hate how i look, how no one could save me from hyperventilating except myself, and how i just feel so alone. i’ve dealt with suicidal tendencies and ideation for years  and i think the fact that the thoughts are starting to become more intense, and view of life is becoming extremely nihilistic, it’s like my brain is like ‘okay, it’s time, you’ve spent all these years thinking about it, it’s about time you come up with a plan’ and i can’t lie, that’s really scary. i don’t hyperventilate often, so this was a really strange experience, that’s why i don’t really want to classify it as any sort of attack because i simply don’t know and i don’t want to falsely diagnose. i just needed to vent about this",1,2025-07-05 04:11:31,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ls16yl/hyperventilating_over_depressive_thoughts/,hyperventilating over depressive thoughts,i cant really determine if i had a anxiety or panic attack or neither but an hour ago i started hyperventilating over my loneliness and depressive thoughts i couldnt breathe for some minutes and all i could think about was how i have no one to talk to about how i truly feel how i wanted to binge eat i calorie count and deal with occasional binge eating and recently with my depressive episodes theyve gotten harder to fight off how i want to kill myself how much i hate how i look how no one could save me from hyperventilating except myself and how i just feel so alone ive dealt with suicidal tendencies and ideation for years and i think the fact that the thoughts are starting to become more intense and view of life is becoming extremely nihilistic its like my brain is like okay its time youve spent all these years thinking about it its about time you come up with a plan and i cant lie thats really scary i dont hyperventilate often so this was a really strange experience thats why i dont really want to classify it as any sort of attack because i simply dont know and i dont want to falsely diagnose i just needed to vent about this

my story,"I just wanted to come out here and share my story. This is about self-harm and depression, if you are feel the same way feel free to reach out, you are not alone (also I need to see a therapist)

\- its not the best but its something (also the grammar sucks) 

I cry, and I get angry. These emotions, I can't control cause I was never taught what to feel about them. I open my dad's cabinet and there I see a razor blade. I touch it by-mistake as I was going to grab something, and it makes a cut on my arm, I watch as the blood comes rushing out fast. I notice the  blood coming out, and enjoy the feeling of being punished like this, it shows that the only way for me to learn from mistakes was to hurt myself. Maybe I would be better if I hurt myself, for something I didn't even do. I understand in the end no matter what problem occurs it will always be my fault, I am a failure.  I start cutting on my forearm telling myself I deserve this, its the only way I can be perfect. My mind says to cut more while my hands hurt with pain. I have blood all over my arms lines of it all over. I understand that I deserve this pain. I wash my arms with cold water and wait for the scars to stop bleeding. I pick a long sleeve shirt from my closet and wear it so no one can notice my arms. I head to my bed, feeling the pain of my arms. It hurts, it hurts a lot. Sometimes I wonder if I could just end my life, I wonder if a car crashes into me or a person murders me, then I wouldn't have to go through challenges with my life and school, then I would just be the perfect daughter my parents wanted (they never wanted a daughter). I shut my eyes tight hide my arm and go to sleep, waiting for tomorrow to be better, waiting for some sunlight in this dim life. 

  
i just told my brother i didn’t self harm knowing i do… he just sees the scratches on my knuckles and asks ""are you okay"" and I laugh it out like its a joke, a pretty funny one. My laughter turns into a lie saying how it was just a cat who scratched me. The words come out of my mouth easily knowing what I did was wrong, I don't feel the need to stop, i feel the need to punish myself more. Why am i not skinny, not pretty, not perfect. One more time I scratch myself thinking why I lie, why im not perfect, how I let my brother figure it out. Why can’t I be a normal person. My mom knew before my brother and I told her a lie again, telling her it was my construction class; the wood scratched me. She got angry saying my teacher should be fired for this, I stood quiet as I knew the truth. She saw the scratches again and she realized it was not the construction class, and again she saw the scratches and rushed to my bathroom and caught me using a blade. She yelled at me saying I was mental and why felt the need to self harm again, she said "" was my parenting not enough"" , how could I let my mother figure it out?, how stupid could I be?. I watch others succeed knowing i’m a failure and don’t know anything, a stupid failure is what I tell myself everyday in the bathroom mirror.  

  
I wake up more depressed, but my family cant see me that way. So i put on a cover, I smile at all the family jokes as my mom and brother joke about me being sad all the time. I try to fit in with my family. But sometimes I just want to be sad and left alone. It’s like being sad is a punishment and I should be happy all the time no matter how worse things get. It’s like a face I have to put on. It hurts. It pains. I avoid all my friends and don’t talk to anyone because of the fear they will ask questions, and I’m not ready to answer them because I’m scared of what others might think of me. I just want to be alone and sad in peace I just want to be left alone in my own thoughts. 

Im scared when people yell at me i am scared of what other will think if I start talking every time I open my mouth it seems as if its always my fault. I cant even express my opinion because my brother keeps on telling me to shut up be quiet but I just wanted to say something. I just wanted to talk I just wanted to express what I felt. Instead I got yelled at pushed away for talking, my parents didn’t even defend me because it’s always my fault, it’s always going to be my fault I’m stupid dumb a fucked up retard. Im just so excited sometimes that I express it then I get shushed about it and then I go away upstairs to hide or cry because all I wanted to do was talk and thats the only thing that was taken away from me. I hate talking now, I understand if I open my mouth people wont like it, they will hate me so I rather just shut up. It’s like that spark in me died, I changed, my imaginations and creativity changed. Everything changed. ",1,2025-07-05 03:58:50,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1ls0z8h/my_story/,my story,i just wanted to come out here and share my story this is about selfharm and depression if you are feel the same way feel free to reach out you are not alone also i need to see a therapist its not the best but its something also the grammar sucks i cry and i get angry these emotions i cant control cause i was never taught what to feel about them i open my dads cabinet and there i see a razor blade i touch it bymistake as i was going to grab something and it makes a cut on my arm i watch as the blood comes rushing out fast i notice the blood coming out and enjoy the feeling of being punished like this it shows that the only way for me to learn from mistakes was to hurt myself maybe i would be better if i hurt myself for something i didnt even do i understand in the end no matter what problem occurs it will always be my fault i am a failure i start cutting on my forearm telling myself i deserve this its the only way i can be perfect my mind says to cut more while my hands hurt with pain i have blood all over my arms lines of it all over i understand that i deserve this pain i wash my arms with cold water and wait for the scars to stop bleeding i pick a long sleeve shirt from my closet and wear it so no one can notice my arms i head to my bed feeling the pain of my arms it hurts it hurts a lot sometimes i wonder if i could just end my life i wonder if a car crashes into me or a person murders me then i wouldnt have to go through challenges with my life and school then i would just be the perfect daughter my parents wanted they never wanted a daughter i shut my eyes tight hide my arm and go to sleep waiting for tomorrow to be better waiting for some sunlight in this dim life i just told my brother i didnt self harm knowing i do he just sees the scratches on my knuckles and asks are you okay and i laugh it out like its a joke a pretty funny one my laughter turns into a lie saying how it was just a cat who scratched me the words come out of my mouth easily knowing what i did was wrong i dont feel the need to stop i feel the need to punish myself more why am i not skinny not pretty not perfect one more time i scratch myself thinking why i lie why im not perfect how i let my brother figure it out why cant i be a normal person my mom knew before my brother and i told her a lie again telling her it was my construction class the wood scratched me she got angry saying my teacher should be fired for this i stood quiet as i knew the truth she saw the scratches again and she realized it was not the construction class and again she saw the scratches and rushed to my bathroom and caught me using a blade she yelled at me saying i was mental and why felt the need to self harm again she said was my parenting not enough how could i let my mother figure it out how stupid could i be i watch others succeed knowing im a failure and dont know anything a stupid failure is what i tell myself everyday in the bathroom mirror i wake up more depressed but my family cant see me that way so i put on a cover i smile at all the family jokes as my mom and brother joke about me being sad all the time i try to fit in with my family but sometimes i just want to be sad and left alone its like being sad is a punishment and i should be happy all the time no matter how worse things get its like a face i have to put on it hurts it pains i avoid all my friends and dont talk to anyone because of the fear they will ask questions and im not ready to answer them because im scared of what others might think of me i just want to be alone and sad in peace i just want to be left alone in my own thoughts im scared when people yell at me i am scared of what other will think if i start talking every time i open my mouth it seems as if its always my fault i cant even express my opinion because my brother keeps on telling me to shut up be quiet but i just wanted to say something i just wanted to talk i just wanted to express what i felt instead i got yelled at pushed away for talking my parents didnt even defend me because its always my fault its always going to be my fault im stupid dumb a fucked up retard im just so excited sometimes that i express it then i get shushed about it and then i go away upstairs to hide or cry because all i wanted to do was talk and thats the only thing that was taken away from me i hate talking now i understand if i open my mouth people wont like it they will hate me so i rather just shut up its like that spark in me died i changed my imaginations and creativity changed everything changed
Relief,"
As I turn around. I see your hand outstretched. 

I know I shouldn’t, but I take the instrument that you offer. I have worked so hard, been strong for far too long. But I need the relief. And in a weak moment, when I am completely and utterly overwhelmed. Unable to keep my head above the water I am doomed to swim in. 

I need the instrument. The relief. 

As I slide my finger along the edge. I revel in the sharpness. A smile flitting across my face for the first time in far too long. 

Sitting down in the chair, I pull my sleeve up. Revealing the shadow of marks from previous  attempts to seek relief. 

Lining the instrument up, I exhale a deep breath and slide the tool along my arm. Not too hard, just enough to bring a trickle. 

Instantly, I feel relief. As the skin parts, I feel the stress exiting my soul. 

Careful to control the depth and speed, I use the instrument. 

Again. 

And again. 

And again. 

Each time feeling the relief of the hurt and anger escaping my body. 

I cannot say that I do not enjoy the action. I have promised I would not lie. I enjoy the instrument far more than i am willing to admit. I walk a fine line of addiction to the release. I understand this. 

But as I pull the sharp edge across my skin I smile. Even let out a little laugh. The relief is overwhelming. 

As I hand the instrument back. I am happy again. I feel lighter. Less stressed. Less hopeless. 

I am not a drug addict. But I am an addict. I am addicted to the relief of the instrument. 

If only for a moment.

How do I explain the difference between burnout and depression?,"Hi,

I suffer from depression and I need help explaining to my mom the difference between burnout and depression.

My mom suffered extreme burnout several years ago. She ended up swishing careers and nullifying her entire university degree because she couldn't keep working there. It was that bad.

I am now living home with my parents due to my depression and I am sicklisted from my studies. Due to my mom's history she understands a lot of the problems I am having, like the mental fog, truble consentrating, sleeping alot etc. 

However sometimes it seems to me like because of her experience with burnout she assumes it must all be the same.

The reason I am now asking for advice is a culmination and a recent situation. I had been feeling down a few days and today while I did go to the grocery store to pick up some things mom had asked for, other than that I had barely left my room. She came into my room during the evening to talk and said that she was disappointed. She said that I was clearly not exhausted (I was feeling pretty alert) either today or the days before but that I just didn't get to doing things (I had promised to go for a walk). That she didn't want to have to keep nagging me to do thing as I am an adult (21). 

It really hurt to have her say that because she is right she shouldn't have to nag me to do things but I really wish she would understand. I don't really know how to explain that I just couldn't go for that walk.

When she was burnt out she had problems with learning to relax and do nothing. I think that is what is currently causing the problem. She never had a problem with doing things, but the opposite. And I don't know how to explain to her what it feels like.

This has become incredibly rambly, so to summarise I would like help explaining the difference in living with burnout and living with depression. And if I am completely wrong and this is just a me problem feel free to tell me so.",3,2025-07-04 21:54:55,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1lruffm/how_do_i_explain_the_difference_between_burnout/,how do i explain the difference between burnout and depression,hi i suffer from depression and i need help explaining to my mom the difference between burnout and depression my mom suffered extreme burnout several years ago she ended up swishing careers and nullifying her entire university degree because she couldnt keep working there it was that bad i am now living home with my parents due to my depression and i am sicklisted from my studies due to my moms history she understands a lot of the problems i am having like the mental fog truble consentrating sleeping alot etc however sometimes it seems to me like because of her experience with burnout she assumes it must all be the same the reason i am now asking for advice is a culmination and a recent situation i had been feeling down a few days and today while i did go to the grocery store to pick up some things mom had asked for other than that i had barely left my room she came into my room during the evening to talk and said that she was disappointed she said that i was clearly not exhausted i was feeling pretty alert either today or the days before but that i just didnt get to doing things i had promised to go for a walk that she didnt want to have to keep nagging me to do thing as i am an adult 21 it really hurt to have her say that because she is right she shouldnt have to nag me to do things but i really wish she would understand i dont really know how to explain that i just couldnt go for that walk when she was burnt out she had problems with learning to relax and do nothing i think that is what is currently causing the problem she never had a problem with doing things but the opposite and i dont know how to explain to her what it feels like this has become incredibly rambly so to summarise i would like help explaining the difference in living with burnout and living with depression and if i am completely wrong and this is just a me problem feel free to tell me so

Struggling with lack of community,"Hello everyone,
I'm an ex-immigrant and now I'm living in my homeland (Asia, where people are intolerant of mental illnesses and glorify domestic abuse). I have severe chronic depression, GAD, ADHD, CPTSD, PMDD, BED, and psychosomatic disorder plus other physical health problems. It's really hard to find good people here who are honest and open-minded and not blinded by culture, tradition, rituals, and religion. Nothing wrong with that, it's just people here follow it to the point of denying science at times, so it's very lonely for me here. I do not even speak the common tongue since my parents are technically from another place within my home country.
Anyway, I've been in therapy for 6 years and on medication for 6 years, but therapy has been completely useless. I've been put on so many medications based on trial-and-error, and I'm so tired of it. Right now, I'm on Desvenlafaxine for depression and chronic pain, Tofisopam, Buspirone, and Clonazepam for anxiety, and Seroquel for sleep (to start soon). Things don't seem to get better. The only thing I'm able to do is work and only because it's neither hectic nor stressful. I am passively suicidal. I have nothing to live for. No community. I've never dated. My family is physically and emotionally abusive. I've been in love with a guy for 9 years now (unrequited). I've literally tried everything under the sun, but now I've just given up hope of getting better. I have nothing to look forward to and I genuinely believe things will not get better. The only reason I even go to the psychologist and the psychiatrist is that I can do the bare minimum (work), so I don't have to depend on my incredibly abusive family. I wish I could leave the country, but I have neither the funds nor the opportunity. It would be nice to have some support, but I'm literally at rock bottom with nothing to lose. So yeah.

5 years later,"5 years ago: The idea that I have to be in my 30s and feel this hopeless about my future is staggering. I can't seem to get a hold of my life long enough to really figure out my shit. I'm so depressed from my lack of anything that I can't find the energy to put it back into myself in a positive manner. I could have learned an instrument or learned a skill set that could actually have brought a career of it. instead, I sit here playing video games, smoke weed and barely employable because of my mood swings from the frustrations of my existence. I just want to find some help so I can get my head straight but this whole world could care less about that. I can't keep a job long enough to get proper medical benefits so I can go see a doctor and I can't afford to not work. I wanted to apply for disability programs but I have no family doctor after my recent move and no one is taking new patients understandably. On top of that, I'm stuck in a basement suite I can barely afford, no income except for the CERB funding I'm not even sure I qualify for and I just want to end it all. This situation seems really hopeless for me and could really just use a way out.

Today: I'm still brutally depressed and haven't been able to get long term work to the point where I am now on disability for the next few years. While this fact had made improvements in my life, I keep failing forwards and was almost homeless last year. I managed to find what I thought was a normal enough roommate so I signed the lease thinking it couldn't be too bad for a while. At first, they were nice but then the compromises started happening. I'm now at the point where my roommate is smoking illegally in our suite in the laundry room and still making me accommodate their needs when I can't even ask for them to close the patio door when they actually decide to use it so no smoke is coming in or do laundry without being accused of entering their bedroom (I'm male and they are females so i take that very seriously) I have barely been eating and I had a full nervous breakdown because I've had to bottle up so much because my therapist had an emergency for over 3 months and I haven't had any professional help since. I ruined my relationship with my mother over it because I can't control the warm rage that just sits there, festering and waiting to go off at the most inopportune moment possible. I know I have multiple mental health problems but I can't find a prescription that doesn't hurt my guts or make me sick. I need advice/ people to talk to. I'm so lonely and isolated and I'm scared that I'm going to do something I'm gonna regret because I can't stop my brain from spiraling

Tldr: 5 years can make some changes but overall, I'm still just a walking corpse of depression and anxiety with no one to talk to.

Getting out of bed,"Hey ya’ll,

How do you deal with getting out of bed in the morning?

This has gotten really hard for me lately. I’ll wake up and then lie in bed for three or four hours before getting up. (I wake up in the middle of the night and use the bathroom so I don’t have to do that when I wake up)

Nothing I’ve found online helps. The articles say to get a pet. I have a cat who wants fed but my mom feeds him early in the morning so I know he’ll be fine until I get up. 

They also say to make a morning routine. I already enjoy my morning routine. I do a tarot reading every morning that fulfills me spiritually.

I put on a YouTube video sometimes while I’m in bed and listen to it and that keeps me from falling back asleep but most of the time I just lie there in the silence. 

I try to have things to look forward to in the day but it doesn’t help. I usually only work in the afternoons so there’s no real reason to get up until the afternoon. 

I honestly don’t know what else to try.

i want to bite the bullet,"i (19) have been struggling with chronic depression since i was 7. these past few months it has gotten much worse, and after many failed attempts in my younger years im heavily considering giving up. 

i don’t struggle solely with depression, i also have autism, generalized anxiety, borderline, and i suffer from psychosis and gender dysphoria. 

realistically, im doing great for myself in the larger scale, i am a piercer which has been my dream job for a very long time, money is not a stressor of any sort. me and my boyfriend are soon to hit one year, and hes a great person to me. but i feel so alone outside of him. 

i live with my best friend and a mutual friend of ours, but i feel like they both are no longer wanting to live with me and i dont have the option of leaving since i am legally tied here (lease) i dont know if these feelings are anxiety or something else but it isnt helping my depressive state at all, and ive tried talking with them abt it and it pretty much solidifies that im going to be removed from living here. its not unwarranted, like i mentioned i have bpd and psychosis, and therefore i go through some very intense episodes and recently had one, but i dont think that one episode is enough to warrant abandoning me.

i dont have any contact with my family for the most part and they make everything i suffer with worse.

when they finally abandon me i will have no where to really turn to, i fear. i cant see myself living without my best friend in the room next to me for the rest of my life and its not a dependency thing but a comfort thing. i love my boyfriend but i dont think were ready to be on our own since were still young. 

i am in therapy but i dont have insurance so i cant afford medication, and im not sure if medication could reverse anything since ive tried medication in the past. ive been in a severe depression slump for about the last 8 months, and i feel itll never end without me ending my life.

since ive had so many failed attempts i want to try and make sure i dont fail this time. im wondering if any otc medications like benadryl could cause me to od and be set free? or should i attempt to purchase a firearm and use that? id rather take the easiest way out for myself which would be an overdose for me so i can hopefully pass in my sleep.

please help :/,"Hello, I’m 21 (F) and I have been struggling with mdd since I was 13/14. I don’t even know where to begin with this and I don’t really have anything I’m trying to say here. I guess this is kind of my last attempt at seeking support.

I’ve attempted suicide around 5 times, all of which have failed (obviously). I’ve tried speaking to multiple therapists, been on high antidepressants for months and honestly, nothing has worked. If anything, it helps for a little and then I’m back to square one. 

I feel so so hopeless, like ending things isn’t even an option anymore. I don’t know what to do. I just want out of my body so so bad.

I stay alone, I don’t have a job or any friends. I am a college student but on most days, I can’t even get myself out of bed to go to class. I’m scared Ive completely ruined any prospect of my future turning out to be stable. And in my experience, death isn’t even an option to get out of this situation anymore as it never even works.

One part of me is scared I’ve been self sabotaging. I was on SSRIs for a while and it did help me see some progress but at one point, I just stopped taking them. I didn’t feel like myself on such a high dosage. I don’t know, I feel like I have nothing to me without my depression since feeling like this is all I’ve ever known. It’s like I can’t live with but I can’t live without being like this.

Just doing this to start documenting what they say from now on. + the creating of trauma.,"I say no to going on a walk as I have been depressed as of late. I had also Just went somewhere with my dad. So she asks if I wanna I say “no” she responds with how they’re gonna go without me EVERYWHERE. She says they’re gonna go to Disney land or random place like Italy. I say is this from past trauma (yes it is, she has been left out as a kid and is taking it out on me.). She said no, then I walked away. She also accused me of only going with my dad because there would be “food” . bitch Syfm we have food here and I didn’t even know that shit. If I have been considering killing myself these last days and I’m very fragile rn. This was my main trigger again opening the wallow of sadness and loneliness. I now feel like doing it again. Just for documentation purposes so I don’t need another post: 
Mom- Guilt tripper, emotionally abusive bitch, tries to start stuff, takes Everything as an attack to her (to start stuff), knows I’m getting depressed, chooses not to take in any other ideas, complains when no one does anything yet refuses when offered, I say anything reasonable and I’m the next hitler, uses my little sister to manipulate others (they know what they’re doing), knows my ONLY reinforcement is letting me be (also knows being rude makes me worse) she also knows i hate confrontation.
Dad- can’t take accountability, alcoholic, hit my (older) sister before, gets mad at others and blames them, threatened to leave my family on multiple occasions, flirting with my moms best friend, etc… 
Lil sis: brat who always is mad and uses my parents to get her way, my mom openly said she’s her favourite. I remember I pointed something sharp at someone and it was 1-2.5 feet away from them and I got yelled at, while my lil sis hit it where my foot was… TWICE whacked it right next to where my head was… TWICE and got a small warning. 
Parents called my lil cousin fat A LOT in front of her (ik that fatass alcoholic aint talkin.) I don’t remember all of these other occasions since I stopped caring a lil bit ago, but ik she fucking did something rude and bitchy for NO FUCKING GOOD REASON. And at supper I got food and while I was going up the stairs I heard “I can’t make that little rat THAT mad. Trust me I try.” And she agreed. It was like it was a competition to them. My dad also OPENLY admitted he gets me mad for no reason at all. 
My dad screamed at me for asking “what” since I couldn’t hear him and he yelled at me “for saying it quietly” (he has bad ears) then blamed/blames me for starting a fight. My (ex) friends always tried to start something, recently I said I didn’t want to play a game and they took it like I said I wanted to kill their grandmas or some shit. And straight up bullied me. I have a recording of most of it.
Me pet died recently, and so far it’s only been getting worse. My motivation is at an all time low. I used to get high marks, played an instrument, drew, worked out, and calorie cautious. I can’t get out of bed now, I eat junk, I have no creativity, no willpower, and I gave up during school. 
I’ve had years of this. I can’t remember everything. I feel numb to it all. It feels easiest to end it. And I’m seriously considering it. (I don’t have enough courage tho.)
